            <title>The Three Types of Content You Need for Successful Event Company SEO</title>
            <description>A lot of business owners think SEO--search engine optimization, or the art of promoting your content on search engines without paying for it--and keywords are something you can sprinkle onto a website like magical fairy dust after it is built. Unfortunately, that is just not the case. To rank on Google, search engine optimization needs to be more than an afterthought—SEO needs to be built right into your website’s structure.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why podcasting companies are getting more into scripted shows</title>
            <description>Podcasting is going Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the past year, HowStuffWorks, Gimlet and Wondery have stepped up their search for content that can be adapted into film, television, or even books as production studios snap up podcasts for high-profile films and cable TV series with A-list talent like Julia Roberts, Connie Britton and Eric Bana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gimlet Media, the startup that began selling film and TV rights to its shows last year, has already exceeded every 2018 goal it had set for Gimlet Pictures, said its head, Chris Giliberti. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Enterprise marketers face more challenges than ever in executing their customer-driven, high-ROI strategies. When customers search nowadays, they are looking for more complete and more specific answers provided for their queries: whether they are searching on a smartphone, looking for results specific to their city, or keeping up with the news of the minute. And Google is constantly improving how it delivers those results.&lt;br /&gt;

Conductors goal is to make sure the marketing team has all of the data and insights, features, and reporting capabilities customer need—so marketers can deliver for their customers and achieve above and beyond their goals. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Wake up law firms, RSS is important for publishing</title>
            <description>RSS is the standard for the syndication of published content across the open web. For law firms, RSS is how their content reaches many readers, especially their blog content.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But of late, I am finding many law firms not using RSS in publishing, even in their blogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other firms have their RSS feeds set up incorrectly. All of their blogs in one RSS feed so users receive content they do not want. RSS feeds kicking out some content, but missing other content – almost like a magazine with blank packages here and there.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The History of RSS</title>
            <description>RSS was first invented by Netscape. They wanted to use an XML format to distribute news, stories and information. Netscape refined the version of rss and then dropped it. Userland Software to control of the specficiation and continued to develop it releasing a newer version. A non-commercial group picked up RSS at the same time and based on their interpretation of the Netscapes original concept of RSS they too released a new version. UserLand was not happy with the non-commercial version and continued development of their own version of RSS (Really Simple Syndication), eventually UserLand released RSS v2.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Are you ready to boost your web traffic? If you are relying on people to find you through the internet, then Search Engine Optimisation should be at the top of your priority result. You can’t be able to generate more leads to your business if nobody finds you. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is podcasting the future of education?</title>
            <description>The U.S. is quickly becoming a podcast nation. According to a 2017 survey, nearly 25 percent of Americans — around 68 million — said they listened to podcasts. Forty-two percent were even willing to pay to do so. The largest contingent of podcast listeners (44 percent) are millennials, and that coveted cohort&apos;s tuned-in attention has attracted advertisers, whose podcast-generated revenue rose from $69 million in 2015 to $220 million in 2017. In the last four years alone, the popularity of podcast listening has doubled.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Facebook Limiting News Feeds To 25 Friends?</title>
            <description>As Reuben alluded and our sources VERIFY, the claim is false. Facebook did announce, in January, it would be changing its status update philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The social network explained it is going to try to show users more posts from friends that have &quot;meaningful interactions.&quot; It plans to do that by reducing the number of articles and videos that appear on news feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, Facebook never said it is limiting news feed updates to 25 friends. Rather, the social network is just prioritizing the statuses users will be more inclined to see.&lt;br /&gt;

Moodlers have access to a delightful and eclectic variety of tools whose time in the spotlight happened a while ago. Email, Forums, Wikis, Blogs. SCORM could not go without mention. No matter how hard Moodle tries to add a fresh face to it, most Moodle experiences today are evocatively reminiscent of a simpler past. To nicely tie up the rooms in nostalgia, its core is built in PHP, the language that refuses to die.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Activism in the Social Media Age</title>
            <description>This month marks the fifth anniversary of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, which was first coined following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. In the course of those five years, #BlackLivesMatter has become an archetypal example of modern protests and political engagement on social media: A new Pew Research Center analysis of public tweets finds the hashtag has been used nearly 30 million times on Twitter – an average of 17,002 times per day – as of May 1, 2018.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Winning the Social Media Marketing Game</title>
            <description>Thousands of years ago, clans gathered around fires to share their days experiences and to tell stories that established group norms and shaped social organization. Today, the fires embers have been replaced by the glow of internet-connected devices, but the communal exchange of stories and perspectives remains a fundamental force in social development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From a business standpoint, a few important differences emerge from this evolution. Social media users can now publicly discuss their experiences with brands or products, forming large coalitions of interest that exert vast social pressure on brands and other organizations. From the presidential election to the newest cereal, everything is now a matter of public interest.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Here Is what you can do if your social media post gets taken down</title>
            <description>Some social media-content is easy to evaluate. Cute cat pictures? Great. Helpful how-to videos? Perfect. Unfortunately, parsing posts gets a lot more complicated when the content flowing through the tubes of social media involves news. Earlier this week, the House Judiciary Committee brought in representatives from Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to discuss the companies policies and practices for evaluating and moderating content (mostly political in nature) and the internet scourge that is fake news.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Up Your Social Media Game By Answering These 8 Branding Questions</title>
            <description>To excel at social media, you must be a social media expert, right? While this is true in some respects, having narrow social media knowledge can also be limiting. A social media-only focus can actually hold back your social media strategy from reaching its full potential. You are building more than a social media presence -- you are building a brand. Social media is not an end unto itself. Vanity metrics -- followers and likes -- may be early indicators of good content, but the true test of social media is business impact. Management will eventually stop paying for social media activity that does not lead to bottom line action.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>However, social media marketing efforts can span far beyond the core four: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. In fact, these popular platforms see such high users yet have such stringent algorithms that it can be hard to ensure your followers see your organic content, much less that your content helps you capture new consumers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>However, with the help of digital tools such as Hootsuite and Google Analytics, tracking social media is a little easier. These tools make it simple to measure engagement, likes and comments. Where people run into trouble though is measuring the actual sales that come from social media. In fact, a whopping 58 percent of brands say they measure engagement but not actual conversions; only 21 percent say they measure conversions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Five tips to help tweens and teens clean up their social media feeds</title>
            <description>Keeping tabs on the rich, famous, and just-plain-cool is nothing new, of course. But social media can take that fixation to a pretty dark place. The feeling is common enough that some doctors are calling it social media anxiety disorder (SMAD) – although what most kids have is more like FOMO ... on steroids. While it is tough to see your kid in despair, there is a good solution that doesn&apos;t require an all-out social media ban: Just help your kid clean up their feed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Self-comparison is a natural part of the tween and teen years. And for most kids, so is social media. While there are plenty of good things kids get out of their online connections, sometimes the combo can lead to a negative feedback loop that gnaws away at them. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Do social networks change our attitudes?</title>
            <description>The network theory of attitudes is a simple idea that has profound implications, if true. This is the theory that when two people hold the same attitude, they are linked together as a result, like two people holding strings to the same balloon. When different people are holding the same bunch of attitudes, they are grouped together and different groups are distinguishable by the different sets of attitudes they are holding. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The conventional thinking is that social media conversations about brands are representative of broader consumer sentiment in the overall market. However a new study from Engagement Labs, appearing in the Journal of Advertising Research, finds online discussions and sentiment are not necessarily predictive of offline brand outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The one constant about social media is change, so it is a good practice to step back once in a while and ensure that your companys strategy is still current and effective.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we enter the second half of the year, it is time to take stock in the social media strategy that was probably developed in late 2017 or early 2018. Is your company up to date on all of the social media platform changes? Do you know what is working and what is not?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 Reasons to Stop Posting Hype on Social Media</title>
            <description>As social media use has risen, I am not surprised that reports show a growing trend among millennials to trust influencers less and less. The hype, bragging and self-aggrandizing make it hard for any of us to believe it is authentic. While there is no harm in a little bragging, Harvard Business Review reports that too much of it or the wrong type of bragging can hurt your chances of getting a job, being trusted or being liked by strangers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Mozillas current plan aims for a removal of both features in Firefox 63 or Firefox 64, out October or December 2018. The change won&apos;t affect the current Firefox 60 ESR version but the next Firefox ESR after Firefox 60 ESR won&apos;t support both features anymore as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We published an overview of Live Bookmarks in 2014, but Firefox supported the feature for much longer. Live Bookmarks allowed Firefox users to subscribe to a site&apos;s RSS feed so that new articles would be displayed in a bookmarks folder in the web browser.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, imposes certain requirements on operators of websites and online services -- including social media sites -- so that personal information from children under 13 is not collected, disclosed or used without parental consent.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Twitter is Cracking Down on Bots</title>
            <description>Twitter is cracking down on bots after it announced changes to its API that will massively reduce the impact of services that allow links and content to be shared across multiple accounts, i.e. the software that powers Twitter bots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So that means an end to services that let those controlling large numbers of accounts to batch tweet, follow users, retweet or like tweets. Twitter will continue to allow content to be posted to accounts using software, for example, weather alerts, RSS feed updates and more, but they will now be limited to a single account going forward.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Social Media Intelligence in 2018?</title>
            <description>Every social media network relies on certain metrics to measure their social media success. Each of these social media metrics plays a critical role in the modern marketing strategy. Global brands utilize social media marketing tools to engage their customers effectively, informing them about the products and services accurately and with better relevance. Companies not using social media analytics for their marketing campaigns find it harder to connect to their online customers, leading to a vortex of unaligned marketing campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Looking for Ways to Improve Your Customer Engagement on Social Media?</title>
            <description>The biggest mistake people make when promoting their brand, company or even themselves on social media is thinking that simply posting is enough. However, that’s far from the case. Managing a Facebook, Instagram or Twitter account means having to strategize ways to keep your current audience captivated, while simultaneously attracting new users to your page.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Twitter pushes trending news to the top of your feed</title>
            <description>As Facebook fights its own fake news problem, Twitter looks like its interested in finding more ways to push news content to its microblogging service. According to a report at BuzzFeed, Twitter has confirmed that it is testing new algorithm-curated timelines when big events happen, then putting tweets from news organizations and other users at the top of your timeline. So far, Twitter says humans are involved in story selection, but a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed that it could be come only algorithmic in the future.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Why would these companies pay when so many of us are willing to do it, as you say, for free? When big tech wants the public to generate a new set of data for them, they design a fun new device designed to train us to do it. And we pay them for the privilege! More and more people have either the Apple, Amazon, or Google home assistant, which we know is already recording our passive conversation for use in improving each company’s voice recognition software and AI. &lt;br /&gt;

Students seem to be making it more difficult for college admission personnel to check them out on social media. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Across 39 countries, a median of 53% say they use online social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. However, that figure conceals large differences around the world, and the relationship between social media use and national wealth is not as strong as it is for overall internet use and smartphone ownership.&lt;br /&gt;

There are still ways to subscribe, but the buttons seem to be gone in the new design.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Today, seven out of 10 Americans use social media. Despite the opportunity (and in spite of the lip-service paid to social), more marketers are skimping on their approach. Reposting 30-second TV spots to YouTube and uploading billboard or print ads to Instagram are commonplace, and a detriment to your brand.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>In 2015-16, roughly four-in-ten adults across the emerging nations surveyed by Pew said they used social networking sites, and as of 2017, a majority (53%) use social media. Whereas, over the same period, social media use has generally been flat in many of the advanced economies surveyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internet use and smartphone ownership have also stayed level in developed markets over the same period vs rising in emerging economies.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social media: should we really be questioning its value for brands?</title>
            <description>Most organisations believe social media has a role to play in their marketing communications, but, equally, most would struggle to explain exactly what that role is. There’s little doubt that social media takes up a significant amount of consumer time and attention but without understanding the influence and quantifying the commercial benefits for brands and businesses, no marketing activity should be above question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like every other marketing activity, a social media strategy must be judged on its positive impact on business or brand metrics. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Cryptocurrencies are digital currency designed to represent the architecture of the internet. Rather than counting on a standard financial institution to guarantee and verify business deals, cryptocurrency transactions are examined or &lt;i&gt;confirmed,&lt;/i&gt; by the computers of the users on the currencys network. The computers used in verifying the deals usually receive little amount of the currency as a reward. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>According to a survey in 2017 by the Royal Society for Public Health, Britons aged 14-24 believe that Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter have detrimental effects on their wellbeing. On average, they reported that these social networks gave them extra scope for self-expression and community-building.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Against the backdrop of social media controversy — remember Facebook, of course, and 87 million users’ data exposed to Cambridge Analytica — oversight is tightening in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The regulatory gaze become more fully trained on social media as in Germany, intelligence official Hans Georg Maassen said last week that regulation may be needed for social media companies if the European Union finds that more transparency is needed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The next money-maker could be this tool for connecting marketers to social media creators so they can team up on sponsored-content Facebook&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ad campaigns. The Branded Content Matching search engine lets advertisers select the biographical characteristics of creators fans they want to reach, see stats about these audiences, and contact them to hammer out deals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leaked screenshots of Facebook’s promotional materials for the tool were first attained and published in German by AllFacebook.de.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Half a million doctors worldwide are sharing their knowledge on a social network for medics to find answers for their patients.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On MedShr, set up in 2014 by a London cardiologist, doctors can post details of cases and other medics can give their input.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A doctor treating a young Afghan refugee in Serbia, who needed plates and pins in his legs, received advice from other specialists that helped formulate a plan to help the boy walk again. In Kenya, hospitals run by junior doctors are able to get remote support from seniors.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Convinced that faith communities would want to share prayer requests, announcements and service opportunities without going to multiple platforms and without being awash in advertising, a group of friends created an app just for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With $2 million in seed money, Pray.com was beta tested with 100 churches in 2016. Today, 6,000 faith communities and thousands of other groups use the app to host their members’ need for prayer and offers of support, as well as to recruit volunteers for local service projects and to collect donations, said two of the co-founders.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>There are some new products and services that are very obviously good&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— a cure for a deadly disease, for example, or some other type of medical innovation. But other innovations have value that is more uncertain, such as an unproven technology. In her latest research paper, Wharton management professor Valentina Assenova examines the role of social networks, both online and offline, in the spread of these complex innovations. &lt;br /&gt;

Oh, sure, it will be voluntary codes of conduct, fights against fake news, but it will amount to much the same thing – it will be possible to say some things on Facebook, Twitter and the like, and not others.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook to open up its data for research on social media and electionsX</title>
            <description>Facebook announced a new initiative today aimed at improving its policies and the role its platform plays in elections. The company acknowledged that it was slow to respond to election interference efforts that took place on its site and says it wants to learn more about social medias role in elections around the world. To do that, it&apos;s putting together a group of researchers that will then develop a research plan, get proposals for projects that address issues defined in its plan and manage a peer review process that will determine who will receive funding and access to Facebook data for their research.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The commission of experts will initially work for one year and Facebook says membership will be determined soon.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Can Social Media Be Saved?</title>
            <description>You&apos;ve probably experienced it yourself. Maybe it is the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed — anxious, twitchy, a little world weary — or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos, knowing she&apos;s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore. Or maybe it was this month&apos;s Facebook privacy scandal, which reminded you that you&apos;ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit-maximizing surveillance machine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls. One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google, which shares a parent company with YouTube — are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Is Email the Best Social Network?</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[The perfect social network would have the following characteristics:<br />
<br />
It would have a lot of users — at least as many as Facebook.<br />
It would filter spam and harassment, but otherwise not algorithmically sort or filter.<br />
It would enable us to interact with people on all the social networks.<br />
It would have no advertising.<br />
It would be user-controllable and user-automatable.<br />
It would be usable on both mobile and desktop.<br />
It would have great search (unlike Facebook).<br />

            <title>Rage against the social media machine: How did it get to this?</title>
            <description>People are angry at Facebook. People are angry at YouTube. People are angry at Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg set to testify before Congress less than a week after an enraged YouTube user wounded three people before killing herself at the companys headquarters, the growing debate over what Silicon Valley’s social media giants do with the content and information we give them has hit a new pitch.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Right, and Wrong, With Social Media</title>
            <description>The appropriate frustration and disappointment resulting from the recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica disclosures are making it easy to forget the personal and economic benefits of social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, let’s not forget that we choose to integrate these services into our daily lives because they allow us to deepen social connections and enable us to exercise our individual agency in a fashion that was impossible before their emergence. Or that these services have created millions of jobs, new business ecosystems and helped fuel the rise of the digital economy that brings broad societal benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it is important not to forget the learning of lessons and the hoped-for change. We are seeing some of these changes now. There is no playbook for addressing the principles at play here, and so it will not be all smooth sailing. But you can be certain that the effort will be earnest and that these services will be better as a result.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Homeland Security database would track bloggers, social media</title>
            <description>Fears about the potential effects of propaganda and fake news remain high, and American officials are determined to keep track of media outlets in a bid to curb these misinformation campaigns. The Department of Homeland Security has put out a call for companies that could create a database tracking over 290,000 &lt;i&gt;media influencers&lt;/i&gt; around the world, including online news outlets, bloggers and prominent social network accounts. The system would identify contributor details (such as contact info and their employers), and would allow searching for individuals and outlets through categories like their locations, the focuses of their coverage and their sentiment.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Everybody uses Facebook because everybody uses Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But lately Facebook — and all the other social networks, for that matter — seems to be turning into a distracting, time-wasting and manipulative &lt;i&gt;surveillance machine&lt;/i&gt; that does more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a huge problem for professionals and businesses of all sizes, including enterprises.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Ethical Social Network</title>
            <description>And yet, unlike other social networks that followed it, HASTAC has managed to remain scandal-free. There have been no mass boycott movements and no accusations that the network ever misused anyone’s data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cathy Davidson, co-founder and co-director of HASTAC, and a professor of cultural history and technology at the City University of New Yorks Graduate Center, said that the secret to the networks good relationship with its users has been its decision to treat user data with respect from the outset. Privacy and security have been priorities for the network since its inception, and are built into every facet of the network.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Time for an RSS Revival?</title>
            <description>RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication (or Rich Site Summary) and it was first stitched into the tapestry of the open web around the turn of the millennium. Its aim is straightforward: to make it easy to track updates to the content of a given website in a standardized format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In practice, and for your purposes, that means it can give you a comprehensive, regularly updated look at all of the content your favorite sites publish throughout the day. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Is Undead</title>
            <description>RSS died. Whether you blame Feedburner, or Google Reader, or Digg Reader last month, or any number of other product failures over the years, the humble protocol has managed to keep on trudging along despite all evidence that it is dead, dead, dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, with Facebook’s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;scandal over Cambridge Analytica, there is a whole new wave of commentators calling for RSS to be resuscitated. Brian Barrett at Wired said a week ago that &lt;i&gt;… anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one thats been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It is time to head back to RSS&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Techmeme Brings Its Aggregation Formula to a Daily Podcast</title>
            <description>Techmeme, the online aggregator of record for technology industry news, is adding some audio in the form of a podcast: the Techmeme Ride Home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beginning today, the site’s new podcast will appear at 5 p.m. every weekday. Over 20 minutes, host Brian McCullough (from The Internet History podcast) will summarize the day’s top tech news and commentary from around the web and social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plain-vanilla news aggregation is unusual in podcasts. Even in tech, podcasts tend to be personality-driven, more often involving hosts providing commentary on the big news of the week rather than just the news itself. McCullough thinks Techmeme can offer something different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Chinese News Aggregation App Targets $3 Billion U.S. IPO</title>
            <description>Qu Toutiao, which means &lt;i&gt;Fun Headlines&lt;/i&gt; in Chinese, is reportedly making its own fun headlines these days, telling sources that it is eyeing an initial public offering that could value it as high as $3 billion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If successful, it would be an extraordinary valuation for a company, a news and video aggregation mobile app popular in mostly rural areas of China, that was launched less than 2 years ago. The company is considering an IPO in New York as soon as early this year, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>These Personality Traits Could Put You At Risk for Social Media Addiction</title>
            <description>According to a new study, people with certain personality traits are more likely to develop a social media addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The study found that three personality traits in particular — neuroticism, conscientiousness and agreeableness — were related to social media addiction. Two other personality traits, extraversion and openness to experience, were not linked with social media addiction.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>US spy lab hopes to geotag every outdoor photo on social media</title>
            <description>Imagine if someone could scan every image on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, then instantly determine where each was taken. The ability to combine this location data with information about who appears in those photos—and any social media contacts tied to them—would make it possible for government agencies to quickly track terrorist groups posting propaganda photos. (And, really, just about anyone else.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is precisely the goal of Finder, a research program of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence&apos;s dedicated research organization.&lt;br /&gt;

Between its numerous acquihires, its aggressive approach to launching (and discarding) moonshots, and its tendency to build impressive products only to kill them months later, Google&apos;s ruthless assessment (and reassessment) of ideas is one of its defining traits.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Twitter fake news problem is getting worse</title>
            <description>&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier this week, we endured another school shooting. This time, in Parkland, Florida, where at least 17 students were killed. During the shooting&apos;s aftermath, hoaxes and disinformation spread on Twitter. It is a phenomenon that happens after every tragedy, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be going away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As is common in these cases, many of the initial fake tweets misidentified the gunman. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook expands breaking news label to more publishers</title>
            <description>Facebook began testing a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;breaking news &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;label for developing stories back in November, and now the social network is expanding the option to more publishers. Starting this week, the company says 50 more outlets in North America, Latin America, Europe and Australia will be privy to the tag. That is in addition to the &lt;i&gt;small group of local and national publishers&lt;/i&gt; that are already using it. If all goes well, Facebook said it may offer the option to even more publishers in the future.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Unlocking the personality of a social media addict</title>
            <description>In this hi-tech, pre-armageddon, screen-filled modern world, social media is all pervasive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has sucked us in. It is the new God. We are now its slave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That might be over-egging things slightly, but for some people, social media has become a true addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, how do you know if your social media habit has descended from a harmless pastime into a full-blown addiction?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Social Media Making Us Elitist?</title>
            <description>For years, we have known that social media platforms inspire jealousy. A 2013 study showed that people fall into a &lt;i&gt;spiral of envy&lt;/i&gt; when Facebook reveals that their friends are excelling or leading glamorous lives. Scientific American reported that many studies indicate that &lt;i&gt;spending a lot of time on Facebook is linked to diminished well-being,&lt;/i&gt; with Facebook-inspired envy increasing feelings of depression. FOMO (fear of missing out) has become a very real thing&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Law enforcement on social media: Instant info or controlling the message?</title>
            <description>Sure, we all get information from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But a growing trend of law enforcement using social media to communicate with the public has led to growing concerns that they are not responding to questions from journalists or not being fully transparent with the public.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Twitter pushes trending news to the top of your feed</title>
            <description>As Facebook fights its own fake news problem, Twitter looks like it&apos;s interested in finding more ways to push news content to its microblogging service. According to a report at BuzzFeed, Twitter has confirmed that it is testing new algorithm-curated timelines when big events happen, then putting tweets from news organizations and other users at the top of your timeline. So far, Twitter says humans are involved in story selection, but a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed that it could be come only algorithmic in the future.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 RSS apps to use now that Digg Reader is dead</title>
            <description>In another blow to RSS fans everywhere, Digg announced that it would soon be shuttering Digg Reader.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of March 26, the RSS service will no longer work on the web or in Digg&apos;s mobile apps. The company didn&apos;t say why it was closing the service, which it started in response to Google killing off its own RSS service in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally, the news was pretty upsetting to Digg Reader fans who had turned to the service as a replacement for the once beloved Google Reader. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you are one of the many folks still clinging to RSS feeds in 2018, you are not entirely out of luck. There are a number of capable alternatives out there. Here are five of our favorites.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Self Hosting Your Podcast Feed is Not Always a Great Idea</title>
            <description>Generally speaking, there are two main ways that you can store your RSS feed:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) On Your Own Website (self-hosting your RSS)&lt;br /&gt;
2) On Your Media Host’s Website (the place where you store your files)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason why I have often elected for self hosting (option 1 above) is a simple one: 100% control. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Nothing lasts forever, I suppose. In what could be construed as a cruel joke, Digg is pulling the plug on Digg Reader, the company’s answer to the demise of popular RSS service Google Reader. Digg Reader will shut down on March 26th, 2018, giving you just enough time to export your data before the service goes dark.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Improve Social Media Marketing Strategy</title>
            <description>Social media marketing plans can decide the future of a business and a brand. As the technologies advance, the boundary between social media marketing and mainstream marketing is becoming more blurred than ever. Chalking out a social media plan is no easy task for a first timer, but getting a few tips from the pros certainly helps. Very simply put, every social action must culminate to a larger social media marketing strategy. People, their likes, shares, replies, and posts should all be a part of a larger plan that generates leads, drives sales, or contributes in other ways to a business goal.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to embed content from the web to your Google Site</title>
            <description>As of December 2017, the new Google Sites lets you embed HTML and JavaScript, as well as other websites. That is a big change from a year ago when the new Google Sites mostly let you share items from Drive, YouTube, and a few other Google sources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The changes make the new Google Sites an even more useful website and intranet site creation tool.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Of course using something like IFTTT you can convert this RSS feed into a different format if you prefer: send the feeds to a read-it-later service or a Google Sheet, for example. The beauty of the RSS format is you can queue up all of your web search hits in the background and then check in on them when you’ve got the time.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Social Media Good for Democracy?</title>
            <description>Facebook is taking a hard look at the impact it has on the democratic process after announcing it could no longer guarantee that social media is beneficial to democracy. One critique of social media is the ability to create echo chambers -- online spaces that only surround users with like-minded people and ideas. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>JSON Feed the New RSS?</title>
            <description>JSON Feed is a new take on the web syndication format, but unlike RSS and Atom its in JSON, not XML. So what does it try to do better?&lt;br /&gt;
Mainly overcome the perils of XML; its complex, heavyweight, difficult to parse and not in sync with the current trend wanting web data exchange happening almost exclusively in JSON document representation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast, JSON is easier to both write and parse, manipulate and consume, especially given that its data types are exact reflections of their native Javascript counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to stand out and make connections</title>
            <description>Social media is great for keeping tabs on your old college roommate or staying in touch with that aunt who lives in another state. As millennials, we’ve grown up with social media being part of our daily lives. It’s probably rare you go through your day without checking your accounts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this day and age of having everything a click away, have you considered the opportunities that could be at your fingertips? Outside of keeping in touch with your friends and family, social media can do wonders for your professional network. Social media has been one of my go-to tools to make connections and grow my network.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Teach Students To Use Social Media (The Right Way) And The Possibilities Are Endless</title>
            <description>CJ Marple wanted to teach his young students how quickly information can spread on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So earlier this year, the third-grade science teacher wrote up a tweet with the help of his students, asking for other users to retweet the message, or even reply to the message with their location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Kansas teacher says he expected 1,000 or so retweets, but within days the tweet went viral and gained more than 227,000 retweets and 75,000 replies from users all over the world. His students, who are probably a little too young for their own social media accounts, learned a lot that week about the power of social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social media mistakes you can avoid for businesses</title>
            <description>Ten years ago if we told people that social media management will be a full-time job, they might have laughed at us. As simple as they are to use, managing a number of platforms for businesses can be quite challenging. With so many platforms and changing algorithms, and hashtags to choose and use, you can easily feel that things are getting out of control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I spoke to my colleague Sarah who manages different social media accounts for our clients and asked her about the common mistakes that people make when managing their brand accounts, and what should business owners avoid doing on social media:&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Google News will be deprecating their old RSS feed subscription URLs by December 1, 2017. That means if you have Google News RSS feed subscriptions from a year or so ago, you will need to go through all those subscriptions and update them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To update your RSS feeds, you need to go to https://news.google.com and select the section you want or create a custom section. At the bottom of the section’s page, click RSS. This will make the feed appear. Copy the URL from the address bar to get the new URL for the RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google told us the old RSS URLs will no longer work effective December 1, 2017.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>If you get the urge to revisit that cute photo you posted some time last year, you&apos;ll have to scroll through your timeline for what feels like hours to track it back down.

            <title>The Basic Social Media Mistakes Companies Still Make</title>
            <description>Over 90% of medium and large businesses have used social media in their marketing for five years or longer. Yet the CMO Survey reveals that nearly half of marketers are unable to show the impact of their social media investments. That’s why, no matter what your social media strategy is, it is always a good idea to go back and make sure you have the basics covered. Your company may discover that it needs a strategic do-over.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Twitter will identify political ads and disclose who paid for them</title>
            <description>Twitter has been in hot water as more evidence emerges showing how Russia used the social network to influence public opinion. Ahead of a November 1st Congressional hearing on Russian manipulation, Twitter has introduced sweeping new rules for how it shares data on political posts. The network will launch a &lt;i&gt;Transparency Center&lt;/i&gt; that lists all ads appearing on Twitter, including promoted ones that previously only appeared to targeted demographics, and will clearly label them when they appear in user feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social networks can learn about you through your friends</title>
            <description>Some people might think that online privacy is, well, a private matter. If you don’t want personal information getting out online, then you can just not put it out there. Right? Wrong. Keeping your information private isn’t solely your choice anymore. Friends can play a big role in your privacy, new data show. And the more they share on a social network, the more that social network can figure out about you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Someone who joins a social network — such as Snapchat, Instagram or Facebook —wants to find their friends. Often, the social network can help. Many apps offer to import contact lists from your phone or e-mail. These apps then use that information to find matches with people already in the network, and suggest them to you.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>6 Social Media Trends to Prepare for in 2018</title>
            <description>2018 is only four months away, and brands have to prepare to take advantage of the opportunities social media presents -- or their competitors will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to reaching audiences, effectively distributing your content, and building a following around your brand, social media offers a wealth of possibilities. It&apos;s where your audiences already live and engage with content, which makes it a convenient platform for brands. Its built-in analytics allow you to track and improve your efforts over time. Plus, all the free social-media tools make it easy to use and maintain an active presence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Create Powerful Social Network Platform in 8 Steps</title>
            <description>How did Mark Zuckerberg change the world? He built a global community that brings people closer together. The origins of Facebook are available to the general public. Everyone is familiar with the story of building social network platform that will greatly impact human relations and economy. Mark&apos;s vision of community opened a door to many variations of social media network platforms that today exist. Jack Dorsey created Twitter in March 2006. Rome may not have been built in a day, but Twitter was built in just two weeks, says Jack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few years later Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger built a pared - down photo app today known as Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Are you still using RSS? If you are (and you should be, as we’ll see in a moment), then you should use the Feed Hawk app on your iPhone and iPad. Feed Hawk puts itself in your iOS Share Sheet and locates the RSS feed(s) from any website you visit. If you want, it can automatically subscribe you to the RSS feed in your RSS reader of choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The latest version of Feed Hawk can even find feeds for YouTube channels. That, in case you are wondering, is huge.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>JSON Feed - The New RSS?</title>
            <description>JSON Feed is a new take on the web syndication format, but unlike RSS and Atom it&apos;s in JSON, not XML. So what does it try to do better?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mainly overcome the perils of XML; it&apos;s complex, heavyweight, difficult to parse and not in sync with the current trend wanting web data exchange happening almost exclusively in JSON document representation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast, JSON is easier to both write and parse, manipulate and consume, especially given that its data types are exact reflections of their native Javascript counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>It takes time to build an audience: you need to attract them to your site, which they’ve likely never heard of, and convert them into loyal readers, so they come back and tell their friends – and eventually turn into customers, which is the whole goal of content marketing. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 things you need to do to create an engaging social media presence</title>
            <description>As of this year, about 81% of the United States population uses at least one social media platform. That number is growing by roughly 5% per year. At this rate, 100% of the United States will have a social media profile on at least one platform by 2021.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Businesspeople searching for the ideal marketing channel to engage prospects should look no further than social networks. Social media provides companies with ample information to create messages targeted to valuable niche audiences, and given the statistics, it is inevitable that the audience you are trying to reach is on at least one social network.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>JSON vs. XML: The battle for format supremacy may be wasted energy</title>
            <description>Back in the late 90s, when standards were proprietary and communication protocols complicated, two data formats appeared on the horizon. The first was the extensible markup language, born as an extension of an existing markup language standard (XML), and designed (by an open committee) with the purpose of storing and defining documents and data through the optional use of a schema.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The other, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), born out of a programming language, was almost the exact opposite – a serialization format with requirements so simple they fit on the back of a business card. XML exploded in application development and communication platforms in the 2000s due in large part to the sheer demand for a human readable, vendor-neutral data format that was easy to read, write and share. As applications and platforms evolved and efficiency grew in priority, APIs evolved to become leaner, and JSON overtook XML as the preferred data interchange format among developers across many technology stacks.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is social media and how did it grow so quickly?</title>
            <description>The popular social media platforms are obvious to most people – Facebook has a UK audience of some 40 million, LinkedIn and Twitter both exceed 20 million, and Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat have close to 10 million each. The reach of these platforms makes it clear that social media is now ubiquitous. But for all the big name players, what is the definition of social media? Where did it come from? And how did it gain such an important role in our lives so quickly?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Social Media Making Me Miserable?</title>
            <description>Back in 1970, the technology writer Alvin Toffler published a book called Future Shock, which became an international bestseller. The book is about how humans struggle with too much technological change in too short a time—and it is all-too relevant today. Social media now dictates how people interact with friends, read the news and navigate their day-to-day existence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is all that doing to the human psyche?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 open source RSS feed readers</title>
            <description>When Google Reader was discontinued four years ago, many &lt;i&gt;technology experts&lt;/i&gt; called it the end of RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And it is true that for some people, social media and other aggregation tools are filling a need that feed readers for RSS, Atom, and other syndication formats once served. But old technologies never really die just because new technologies come along, particularly if the new technology does not perfectly replicate all of the use cases of the old one. The target audience for a technology might change a bit, and the tools people use to consume the technology might change, too.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Social Media Users Should Never Lower Their Guard</title>
            <description>When it comes to social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, I am guarded when it comes to whom I friend or follow. I use Facebook almost exclusively to connect with friends, family or business acquaintances. I use Twitter mostly for news and commentary that&apos;s of interest to me personally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there is another social media site I use a lot, and that is LinkedIn. LinkedIn differs from Facebook and Twitters generalized social interactions by focusing on helping people make and maintain professional connections. LinkedIn was purchased last year by Microsoft for $26.2 billion, and has become Redmonds foray into social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Top 6 RSS Reader Apps for iOS</title>
            <description>RSS really does not get as much love as it used to, and that is actually a shame. Being able to pull stories from multiple sources into one good app is great, especially when you can customize these to show what’s important to you. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Can social media be regulated?</title>
            <description>If millennials are the yardstick by which we measure what drives communication on social media, then it would seem that all eyes should be on social messaging platforms such as WhatsApp this year. This is the view of Dominique Pienaar, CEO of DUO Marketing &amp; Communications, who says these platforms are becoming increasingly popular due largely to the immediacy of contact and response and are certainly preferred platforms among the millennial market when it comes to one on one, broadcast and group communication.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social media: Marketing in a digital age</title>
            <description>What was once a world of snail mail, magazines, and newspapers is now a world of cell phones, email and social media. There is no mistaking the up rise and importance of new technology in what is now a digital age. In the past, advertising was a more simplified process. You could advertise in a newspaper or magazine, or leave flyers on someone’s doorstep or mailbox. You could buy air time for a commercial or buy space on a billboard. However, as technology grew and evolved, so did our methods of advertising. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What should I do to advertise my business? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Most Popular Social Networks With Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers</title>
            <description>Although Facebook is the most popular social network across generations, it is not as dominant with younger people as it is with older ones, according to recent research from Sprout Social.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The report was based on data from a survey conducted in January 2017 of 1,000 Millennials (age 18-34), Gen Xers (age 34-54), and Baby Boomers (age 55+) in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of 65% of Gen Xers as well as Baby Boomers say Facebook is their favorite social network.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Under House Bill 5012, a person can be penalized for creating a social media account using someone elses identity. Alvarezs proposed measure also mandates social media networks to verify the identity of their users.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Fishbrain is a social network for fisherman</title>
            <description>In an age of pervasive digital entrepreneurism, there is a social network for practically every subculture under the sun. Take Codias, for example — it is a network for political conservatives. There’s Sermo, a forum for doctors. And HoffSpace is an internet fan club dedicated to television star David HasselHoff. But one of the fastest-growing niche networks has nothing to do with politics, profession, or celebrity obsession. It is called Fishbrain, and it is a social network for fishermen.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook shows no sign of stopping, now has 1.86 billion users</title>
            <description>Facebook is under quite a bit of pressure of late. It&apos;s trying to fix the rise of fake news and clickbait on its News Feed and, more recently, it&apos;s had to deal with the Zenimax lawsuit against Oculus. But all of that hasn&apos;t eaten into Facebook&apos;s bottom line. As its Q4 2016 earnings report shows, the company once again raked in cash hand over fist, with $8.8 billion in revenue and $3.56 billion in profit. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How To Build Your Podcast Audience By Guesting</title>
            <description>Podcasting is hard, time-consuming work, and it can be incredibly frustrating when your shiny new episode only gets a handful of downloads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many different strategies you can use to build your audience, but today we&apos;re going to focus on guest podcasting, which I will lovingly refer to as &lt;i&gt;guesting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The wrath of social media! Face-to-face conversation becoming a passé</title>
            <description>With social media substituting real-life communication, one-third of people communicate less face-to-face with their loved ones, a key factor for damaging relationships, a study has found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The findings showed that a significant third of people communicate less with their parents (31 per cent), children (33 per cent), partners (23 per cent) and friends (35 per cent) because they can see and communicate with them via social media. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Guest Blogging: The Winning SEO Strategy Most Bloggers Miss</title>
            <description>Most of us think of Search Engine Optimization as a feat of technical wizardry, and it can be. From using proper keywords to using tools to automate publishing to social media, being tech savvy plays a big role in getting traffic. The mistake is forgetting that readers do not just have favorite blogs; they have their specific interests. Taking your content and commentary beyond your blog can help build authority and drive a lot of traffic your way. Thats where guest blog posts can be an effective tool. In 2014, Googles Matt Cutts declared guest blogging dead because it had become &lt;i&gt;too spammy.&lt;/i&gt; So why do it? Because Google rewards quality, and a comprehensive, high-quality guest post that links back to your site is at least equally good for SEO as a great post on your own site.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How To Make Money With Your Business Blog</title>
            <description>No matter how popular your blog is, it won&apos;t make money if you do not monetize it. And even a well-designed and monetized blog can not make money if you do not know how to promote it. Too many recent posts on this topic have failed to point out that what works for the rich and famous is unlikely to work for your small business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Neil Patel writes about how to create a blog and mentions that his site earns over $1 million dollars a year, I hope people realize that even when he did this with a brand-new blog, he is still the well-respected, world-famous Neil Patel. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>I Used Social Media and Blogging to Become Famous for Nothing</title>
            <description>In 2006, I set out to brand myself. I had an idea that I shared with the owner of the small company at which I was employed. I called it &lt;i&gt;Publish or Perish, &lt;/i&gt;and despite the lack of originality, the idea was simple, but purposeful: We needed to elevate the name recognition of our company -- quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The company had made a fortune working with a niche client, but unwisely, it chose to fly under the competitions radar. In other words, it did the opposite of marketing for fear that if competitors knew how much money it was making from this niche client, it would face stiffer competition. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Social Media Leading to Tired Students?</title>
            <description>Teens spend more time in front of screens than they do sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to a 2015 report by Common Sense Media, teens spend upwards of 9 hours a day consuming media on screens. And while the National Sleep Foundation recommends that teenagers get a 9 and 1/2 hours of sleep each night, the average American teenager sleeps around 7 hours each day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lack of proper sleep has been connected with reduced cognitive functions and lower academic performance. Teens may be tired because instead of sleeping soundly they are sleeping with their smartphones. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Analytics and Data Will Change Social Media in 2017</title>
            <description>As we wind down the year and look back on 2016, we find that social media is on everyones lips–but perhaps for different reasons than we social media marketers would imagine or prefer. The discussion happening around social media at the end of the year is about responsibility and control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The outcomes of the EU Referendum in Great Britain and the American presidential election were no doubt influenced to a greater or lesser degree by social media, from President-elect Donald Trump’s insistence on using Twitter as an unfiltered direct communication channel with his followers and critics, to the soul-searching happening in some quarters about the role social media played in serving up news stories to the American electorate.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>18 Tech Predictions for 2017</title>
            <description>Predicting the future is hardly a precise science, but identifying macro trends and developments can be done by paying close attention to what is happening in an industry. Here is what a handful of small businesses, startups and analysts are seeing in their crystal balls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. We will hear more about how autonomous cars connect to the network.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Funding will skew toward artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). And most of it will be a bust.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Mobile will continue to rise as the primary shopping platform.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Companies Will Use Social Media In 2017</title>
            <description>Lets travel back to a simpler time, shall we? It’s November 6, 2007, and Facebook has just launched something called Pages. Now, companies can have an official presence on the network, just like real people! The first day, 100,000 Pages launch, with brands from Coca-Cola to Verizon and Blockbuster getting onboard. In the years afterward, millions of companies raced to build up audiences they can reach directly and on-demand, through the sheer magic of social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fast-forward to the waning months of 2016, and the magic is a little harder to feel. Certain corners of the social world have become uglier places, with some in the business world calling for a draw-down.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kill the Newsletter Converts Newsletter Subscriptions Into RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Newsletters are not all bad, but getting them in your email can be a bit disruptive. RSS is a good place for them because you are used to a seeing lot of content in that kind of feed and you can look back on it whenever you want. Kill the Newsletter creates a fake email address for you, then creates a RSS feed for any newsletter you send to that email address. It is a super easy to use system that works really well for anyone still holding onto RSS.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Uber creates an AI lab to help fuel its self-driving dreams</title>
            <description>If Uber is going to make its dreams of self-driving ridesharing cars a reality, it is going to need a lot of expertise in artificial intelligence... and it is taking big steps to make that happen. The company has created Uber AI Labs to fuel its research, and it is getting the team started by acquiring AI startup Geometric Intelligence. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is also a preemptive strike against the competition. The company tells the NYT that there is a fierce battle for AI talent -- acquiring Geometric Intelligence prevents Uber from losing out to Lyft, Google and others hoping to put machine learning to work on the road. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can&apos;t even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media nurturing has to be a requirement for all businesses.

            <title>How to safely introduce children to the social media world</title>
            <description>Parents have plenty of reasons to worry about what their kids do online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dangers seem to lurk in every corner of connected life, especially for children. Remember that federal regulation prohibits children under the age of 13 from joining most social networking sites. Even so, more than 20,000 kids try to sneak their way onto Facebook — with or without their parents help — every single day.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>A Chicago company has marketed a tool using text, photos and videos gleaned from major social media companies to aid law enforcement surveillance of protesters, civil liberties activists say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The company, called Geofeedia, used data from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as nine other social media networks, to let users search for social media content in a specific location, as opposed to searching by words or hashtags that would be less likely to reveal an exact location.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Despite the huge popularity of social networking among teens, more respondents reported using Gmail than Snapchat or Facebook, June 2016 research uncovered. The only site used more than Gmail was YouTube, which is not surprising given the plethora of content and influencers available on the video-sharing site. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook will show bigger vertical videos in your News Feed</title>
            <description>Facebooks News Feed for mobile will become much friendlier to vertical videos in the near future, according to Marketing Land. It will not exactly be optimized for the orientation the way Snapchat is, but it will apparently stop cropping and showing them as tiny squares. The publication says when the update rolls out for Android and iOS, you&apos;ll start seeing vertical videos with a 2:3 aspect ratio (as opposed to 1:1) on your News Feed without having to expand them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>According to Mashable, some affected users see an icon on videos that you can tap to toggle sounds or or off. That sounds manageable, and we can imagine people liking the feature. However, other testers are reporting that sounds automatically start up when videos play on their News Feed, so long as their devices aren&apos;t on silent mode. &lt;br /&gt;

According to the survey, the majority of consumers, at least 54 percent, say they are more likely to hire an attorney who has an active presence on social media than a lawyer who isn’t. This is especially true for consumers between the ages of 18 and 44 – at least 69 percent said they would hire a lawyer who is active on social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The History of RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS was first invented by Netscape. They wanted to use an XML format to distribute news, stories and information. Netscape refined the version of rss and then dropped it. Userland Software to control of the specficiation and continued to develop it releasing a newer version. A non-commercial group picked up RSS at the same time and based on their interpretation of the Netscapes original concept of RSS they too released a new version. UserLand was not happy with the non-commercial version and continued development of their own version of RSS (Really Simple Syndication), eventually UserLand released RSS v2.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Use Social Media for Marketing</title>
            <description>Imagine if you were an entrepreneur in the late 1980s, or even 10 years ago. It may be hard to believe, but at that time — and in all other eras of business history except now — social media did not exist. You relied on word of mouth, paid advertising, and old-fashioned grunt work to get the message out about your business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of that is still necessary — any savvy entrepreneur knows you should not rely on social media alone to promote your business. Despite its pervasive reach, social media still only reaches a limited and largely distracted audience. For that reason, you have to take care with your social media promotion. Unfortunately, you can’t flood your account with random tweets and sell huge volumes of product.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 Tips to Optimise your Social Media Reach</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>Use a Conversational tone On Facebook</b><br />
Facebook is probably the only site that still holds that perfect mix of business and pleasure. In order to not upset that balance and lose followers, your posts and updates should blend in perfectly with your fans and encourage more click-through. While repurposing Facebook for marketing, make sure to use a conversational tone to sound less spammy.<br />
<br />
<b>Follow the 80/20 Rule</b><br />
Just making your presence felt over social media is not enough, it has to be worth following in the first place. Make sure to post valuable, productive and useful content instead of just promoting your company. The most useful tip to keep in mind is the 80/20 rule, where 80 percent of all your posts should be of value to your audience and 20 percent will be self-promotional.<br />

            <description>From solo entrepreneurs to Main Street businesses and multinational brands, marketers at all levels struggle with finding new ways to keep their followers’ attention.

Your followers need variety. If you don’t mix it up a little bit, you’ll risk losing their attention permanently. To inject some diversity, start working these 10 social post structures into your daily content calendar. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media is Transforming Marketing</title>
            <description>Everyone realizes the importance of social media marketing. Businesses are tapping benefits of using networks created on social sites to sell products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is social media marketing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social media marketing is using social sites such as Facebook, Twitter and many of the social media tools to create awareness about products. It is an approach where business can reach their customers. Many customers interact with brands through social media. A company that has a high social media-marketing plan can thus tap into the opportunity and increase their customer base. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Filtering RSS Feeds With Inoreader</title>
            <description>When Google killed Reader back in 2013, many people worried that it was the end of RSS feeds—an open source format that websites used to syndicate their posts automatically. Instead, it actually led to a huge degree of innovation. Now, three years later, things have never been better.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Implementing A Social Media Advocacy Program – How to Guide</title>
            <description>There was once a time when companies could only see the negative side of social media and as a result many banned the use of it within company hours. However, in more recent years I have witnessed companies becoming increasingly savvy about how to leverage the potential benefits of their employees’ extensive social networks. I have worked with several clients (ranging from blue chip multinationals to smaller more boutique affairs) on how to do just that. Today I want to share with you the ins and outs of implementing your own company-wide social media advocacy program.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>It does not really seem like Apple News has taken off nearly as much as Apple likely hoped it would, but if you only visit a handful of web sites, it is actually a pretty solid RSS reader if you know how to use it right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you first launch News, it seems like you can only go through and pick Apple-approved sites and topics. But you can actually customize it however you want in one of two ways:&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Opera published a new version of Opera Developer today that introduces basic RSS Feed functionality in the web browser.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The big new feature in the release is support for RSS Feeds. This is not an entirely new feature though, as other browsers support RSS feeds natively as well. Firefox for instance supports live bookmarks which basically list the latest articles posted by a site using RSS.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social media helps charity to monitor the flow of blood cancer conversations</title>
            <description>For more than 56 years the charity I work for, Bloodwise, has been working to beat blood cancer, the third most fatal form of cancer. In our work, we have had to constantly evolve and adapt to meet the ever-changing needs of our supporters and patients.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unsurprisingly, the rise of digital channels has been transformational for us, from the delivery of patient information online to communicating with supporters via social media. However, as the importance of digital grew, we knew we needed to use data and insight to understand our online audiences better and measure our performance.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Oh No! Did Facebook Just Kill Unpaid Marketing Content?</title>
            <description>On June 29, Facebooks algorithm change rocked the content world. The social media giant announced it would start prioritizing posts shared by friends and family over content from publishers and brands. That’s bad news for brands that have come to rely on social media sites like Facebook as a major web traffic driver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Facebook accounts for 41.4 percent of referral traffic to news sites, according to Parse.lys April 2016 Authority Report. But not all is lost. While brands may be in trouble, content published and shared by individuals could gain even greater traction. That’s good news for industry influencers and budding thought leaders.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Parsing an RSS News Feed with a Bash Script</title>
            <description>I am involved in several free software projects, including one or two where I maintain the website. For one of those projects, we currently are updating the website. Ours is probably similar to other free software projects. We use a hosting service for several key services, including news, but we run our website on a web server that we own. In our case, we run most of our project on SourceForge and run the website on a third-party service, so the news and website are on different systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, our project uses an RSS feed to pull news items from SourceForge to display on the project website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&lt;i&gt;Two years ago, I wrote a story about Nextdoor, a private social network that requires users to register with proof of both their identity and address. Once accepted, you belong to a neighborhood and can see and speak with any nearby users who have signed up. It&apos;s trying to build a local graph to complement the social graph, and it has quietly grown into one of the largest social networks in the US, with over ten million registered users spread across more than 100,000 neighborhoods.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[Maintaining assets used to be considered a <i>necessary evil</i>, but manufacturers now see strategic asset management as an important way of delivering value and achieving competitive advantage.<br />
<br />
With the emergence of sensors and novel data collection technologies, we can connect and monitor assets in a way that is light years from the old method of maintenance, which was essentially ‘wait until a machine fails and then fix it’.<br />
<br />
The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a new paradigm called <i>e-maintenance </i> where assets can be monitored remotely. This enables OEMs to provide innovative maintenance service solutions to their asset users.<br />

            <title>If My Mom Invented a Social Network</title>
            <description>If my mother invented a social network it would be a lot like Pinterest. Thousands of pictures, tons of content, and everyone talking with everyone about everyone else’s favorite things. This social network would consist of people just like my mother, caring, hip, and quickest to the draw when the silence calls for a witty comment.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Line Vs. Facebook And The Future Of Social Networking</title>
            <description>With Lines IPO, I thought this would be a good time to ask about the role that new social networks will play in the larger social network ecosystem. Will they cannibalize Facebook’s usage? Or can we expect to see the biggest players continue to be dominant in social networking?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you who don’t know, social networking has a special place in my heart. In 1997, I launched the world’s first online social network called sixdegrees. And as part of that, we wrote a patent that defined a social network as the ability to index multiple relationships in a single database. It gives you the ability to see the people you don’t know through the people you do know.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>This is what happens to your social network accounts after you die</title>
            <description>Facebook has 1.6 billion users. Inevitably, a sizable portion of those people pass away, leaving behind a number of inactive social media accounts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last year Facebook took a major step forward in how to deal with the 8000 plus deceased accounts that appear on the social network each day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its Legacy contact scheme helped make dealing with the death of a loved one easier on the world&apos;s largest social network.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Social Media Response to Nice Was Heartbreakingly Familiar</title>
            <description>In what has become a heartbreaking routine—employed during the Paris attacks of 2015, as well as after recent terrorist attacks in such places as Belgium and Istanbul — people shared emotional memes in solidarity with the city of Nice, where 84 people were killed by a truck driver barrelling into the crowd on the Promenade des Anglais.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using the hashtags #PrayForNice or #JeSuisNice, people expressed solidarity over the deaths of at least 84 people, which French President Francois Hollande says was caused by an act of terrorism. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Startup Life in Hi-Fi launches mobile news feed of publisher content, selectable by hashtags</title>
            <description>Mobile users spend little time viewing web content on their mobile browsers, preferring to read most of it through their social networks. As a result, publishers are losing control of their content, and users are overloaded with content sources.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Look at How Social Media is Impacting Divorce Cases</title>
            <description>Most people with a smartphone are constantly tapped into some form of social media. Sharing cute pictures of kids and pets is simply a routine part of life these days. Some people even use social media to vent frustrations or look for advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a divorce case, however, shares on social media can create ample evidence that can be used against one or both parties to affect alimony, child support, child custody, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Email and Text Messages&lt;br /&gt;
Email and text messages are admissible in court and can even be subpoenaed. If one party in the marriage reveals something about a new job or an upcoming bonus that has not been revealed in court, this can be used as evidence that the person is not being honest in his or her financial declarations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Subscribe to Reddit Domain Feeds</title>
            <description>One lesser known feature of Reddit is the ability to display all submissions that a domain or site received on Reddit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mentioned this option two years ago for the first time and don&apos;t want to rehash everything I said in the previous article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may have stumbled upon it accidentally by clicking on the domain link next to submissions that lead to external sites as it will display the feed of that domain directly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The feature is quite useful for a number of reasons. As a webmaster for instance, it is easy enough to check all the direct mentions of your site on Reddit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Five Android apps to feed your RSS needs</title>
            <description>If you are a news junkie, you probably depend on various and sundry RSS feeds—so you most likely need a handy app to curate them into a single, easy-to-use location. Fortunately, plenty of Android apps are available to handle all your RSS needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
For those who are new to RSS, here&apos;s a quick overview. RSS stands for rich site summary (or really simple syndication). It enables sites to publish frequently updated information in a format that is easy to consume (by both apps and humans). The format of RSS tends to be a title and a one-sentence or one-paragraph blurb. Readers can click on the title, which will take them to the original piece.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different apps offer different features for RSS feeds. I have found five apps in the Google Play Store that I believe represent the best features and the most user-friendly interfaces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Trends to Watch</title>
            <description>Influencer Marketing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the latest Nielson study, over 90% of consumers trust recommendations from friends and family. We have slapped a fancy name on it, but at the end of the day, this is what influencer marketing really is: getting products into the hands of people whom others trust. Peer recommendations have the power to sway buyers and inspire purchase decisions, not because they have a zillion followers or have perfect lips, but because they are reliable, personable sources we believe.</description>

            <title>How to get your Twitter RSS feed using this simple hack</title>
            <description>Twitter has eradicated RSS feeds from its web interface once and for all, following an update to the sites search page today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Twitter launched its redesign late last year it subtly removed RSS feeds for users tweets. And while RSS feeds are still available, you have to be willing to jump through some extra hoops to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there was some suggestion that their removal was accidental, but some 10 months&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;later this seems not to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Make Your Own RSS Feed</title>
            <description>For news, sports, entertainment, online publications and blogs, the benefits of implementing an RSS feed is obvious: Deliver information to your visitors even when they are not actively surfing your site, and they will be sure to come back when an item piques their interest. For other types of businesses, an RSS feed can keep you top-of-mind with your past customers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Top 10 RSS Feeds For Medical News &amp; Alerts</title>
            <description>Health is definitely one of those things we do not notice till it starts to ebb away. Isn’t it also true that medical news is the last thing you like to read or see in newspapers and television? That is, if you do not have any illness in the family. I pray you do not, but if you do then the web has always been a secondary source of some great information. The first source should always be your general practitioner and physician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no harm in arming yourself with information when you need to talk to a doctor. A better informed patient (or a patients guardian) makes for a wiser decision maker. We are living on the cutting edge of great medical leaps. Medical news and alerts help us to keep pace with these leaps. Let’s look at some top websites for RSS medical news feeds and stay alert with the help of their feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>New-age publishers are toying with innovative content models that offer more value to end users and set their cash registers ringing. It does not come as a surprise, when content is evolving as a major source of income for them. By offering high-value content and a trove of inbound links, digital publishers can maximise the profitability of their websites. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Addiction</title>
            <description>I remember a time before Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, emojis, instant messaging and memes. I remember when my friends used to ride their bikes passed my home to see if I was there -- now, we always know where everyone is. Sometimes because it is self-reported (on a social media platform) but also because we can send them a quick text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the term digital native is a little too loose for me, the date range is too baggy around the sides. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Marketing Leaders Should Personally Engage More In Social Media</title>
            <description>&lt;i&gt;I was interviewing Antonio Lucio, the CMO for HP, for my CMO Insight series (see article here), when we started talking about social media. For perspective, Lucio has over 33,000 Twitter followers, has a 62 Klout score, and is the 4th most influential CMO on Twitter (see list here). I asked him why he is so personally involved in Twitter. Very few CMOs tweet and of those who have a lot of followers, few tweet themselves, instead delegating the task to somebody on their marketing team. His response to my question was fascinating, and an important one for any CMO or aspiring CMO to hear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feds will now check your social media history before granting security clearance</title>
            <description>The federal government has confirmed that it will start targeting social media posts by prospective employees as part of its review process for security clearance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new policy, which will allow investigators to scan an applicant’s history on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other similar sites, will be adopted soon, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guidelines make clear that agencies can target publicly available social media posts, if they deem it necessary, but cannot force individuals to hand over their passwords for private accounts, or provide pseudonyms for any profiles.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media gives Customers Power over Brands</title>
            <description>Not so long ago, customers were isolated. Their ability to voice their dissatisfaction with the service they received from business was severely limited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The once feared television show Fair Go was just about their only option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today they can air their gripes instantly on Facebook, Twitter or other social platforms and build alliances with similarly disgruntled customers. They can take pictures wherever they go and record or even film their interactions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Are You Paying Enough Attention to Customers on Social Media?</title>
            <description>Although consumers want brands to use social media as a two-way communication channel, the vast majority of businesses are not adhering to those desires, according to a study from social media management software provider Sprout Social. On average, businesses send out 23 promotional messages for every one consumer response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social media is now the No. 1 way consumers interact with businesses. The research revealed that 34.5 percent of consumers turn to social media first when they have a problem, compared with just 16 percent who call and 5 percent who visit a store in person.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Many investment professionals are naturally competitive people, myself included. Accustomed to being benchmarked and trained to quantify impact, we run an unusual risk of thinking that social media is a contest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But applying that perspective is counterproductive. It is a bit like going to a dinner party and trying to keep score. People might be into it if you have strange friends, but there’s a better chance that you will alienate everyone there.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Add a custom RSS feed to your Android home screen</title>
            <description>You turn to RSS. That is right, we are going old school. For those who don&apos;t know, RSS stands for Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication. It&apos;s a very easy protocol that allows feeds to be pulled from websites to serve up a collection of story summations that the reader can then click on and enjoy the full read.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to use PressForward for content creation</title>
            <description>We live in an age of information overload. With all the stories from news, blogs, social media, and other sources, the amount of information about any given subject can be overwhelming. It is hard enough to keep up when you are just a consumer of information, but what about when you need to curate content for a target audience?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, there are tools that can collect and organize information from a large number of sources, making that task easier. One such tool is the PressForward plugin for WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PressForward is a multi-user, collaborative RSS feed reader that integrates with WordPress&apos; publication work-flow and provides users with the ability to curate content for a target audience. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>IFTTT breaking news alerts: Get personalized news sent to your phone with this Feed Rinse super-recipe</title>
            <description>It is difficult to get real-time alerts about articles with specific headlines on specific subjects from specific websites. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
News reader applications like Feedly or Flipboard are great for browsing and even searching through news items, but they lack the ability to send notifications proactively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emails from Google Alerts can be tardy, and at other times, articles can slip by completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never fear!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Used together, two web applications, IFTTT and Feed Rinse,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;solve this problem easily.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Insanity of Dumping RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>We are a great believer in achieving the widest possible distribution as possible. RSS feeds allow that because they can be easily consumed in many places. RSS was one of the principle ways in which the early bloggers were able to syndicate their content and achieve large scale distribution. To this day, RSS remains one of the best ways to get content onto many people’s screens in as friction free a way as possible.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>~ Over 70% of teens have smart phones which means they have access to the internet which in turn means they have easy access to pornography.&lt;br /&gt;
~ Most teens are on their phones all the time - in school, in bed at night, when they go to the bathroom, while you are trying to talk to them, and while they are trying to do their homework.&lt;br /&gt;
~ They are in instant access with each other all the time - living in a perpetual state of staccato interruptions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>In Defense of the RSS Feed for Comics</title>
            <description>Since starting the Johnny Bullet comic strip, I’ve begun reading many more web comics than before to the extent that I read more of them than print or digital comics. It has been an interesting transition from one of those comic book store devotee to getting most of my comics from individual creators online. One technology has helped make this transition possible. It is the RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media is a double-edged sword, providing both benefits and drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to stay connected, many of us are becoming captivated by these pervasive tools. A social media report by Sensis in 2015 reported that nearly half of all Australians access one or more social networking sites every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The report also found that Australians now spend an average of 8.5 hours a week on Facebook alone, with 24% checking social media more than five times a day. Seven in ten people used a smartphone to access their accounts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 Insider Tips to Rock Your Social Media Presence</title>
            <description>Social media is a blessing for small business entrepreneurs to spread the word about their business without spending a huge amount of advertising dollars. Nevertheless, a majority of small businesses are not able to capitalize on this opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A recent ProOpinion poll found that many small business professionals don’t use social media or a social media calendar on a regular basis. Only 31 percent post frequently on social media, and whats even worse, just 15 percent interact with their audience.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is New in Social Media Customer Service</title>
            <description>I previously analyzed their 2013 report and their 2014 report and came to the same conclusion each year. Most companies still do not get social media as a customer service channel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Six years ago, I did my own tiny social media study. That is back when the Starbucks Twitter profile said that some guy named Brad did the tweeting. Things are pretty much the same as even back then. (Except for Brad. I am not sure what happened to him.)&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Complex Link Between Social Media and Depression</title>
            <description>The more time young adults spend using popular social media, the greater the link to depression, new research suggests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The finding stems from research—which involved nearly 1,800 men and women between the ages of 19 and 32—that tried to get a handle on how depression and social media habits may interact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But does greater involvement with social media actually promote depression? Or, are people who are already depressed simply more likely to gravitate to social media? The jury, according to the study authors, is still out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media is not always an online distraction or procrastination platform. While some may be addicted to their social media networks, it is one of the best ways to stay informed. Major news outlets, corporations and persons of interest use social media to deliver messages to the masses. With items posting immediately, the public stays informed. Some issues cause controversy, but social media does more good than harm in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Matters</title>
            <description>When it comes to online reviews, business owners take the good with the bad. Reviews can be highly influential. On the upside, positive reviews highlight things such as terrific customer service, stellar products, delicious food and the like. There is a local Facebook group for Kansas City foodies, and a positive review of a new restaurant can be a major boon to a new local eatery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the flip side, even the most customer-focused and conscientious of businesses will eventually get a less than favorable review. It’s simply the law of averages. Reviewers definitely do not lack places to post their comments: Traditional review sites like Yelp are always in play, but people also take to Twitter and Facebook to air grievances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 ‘90s Social Media Sites From Before Social Media Was A Thing</title>
            <description>I know we think of social media as being a new millennium thing — but the truth of the matter is that the seeds of what would become the social networks we know, love, and sometimes hate today have been around for a heck of a lot longer than the mid-2000s. And these 90s social media sites from before social media was a thing? They are proof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the sites on this list were originally founded in the late 90s, so I suppose we might also be able to consider them social networks from the early 2000s; after all, that’s probably when a lot of us actually started using them. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media narcissism is on the rise. The team behind Psychology Today compiled research to show that millennials could be the most narcissistic generation in history. Social media is one of the exemplifications of the problem. That is not to say that everyone on social media is a narcissist, but it is where these people tend to hang out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>What Are RSS Feeds?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RSS Feeds&lt;br /&gt;
RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content. RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feds Launch Social Media Verification Registry</title>
            <description>The U.S. Digital Registry was announced Jan. 29 as a one-stop shop for the social networking needs of government departments who are actively engaged on such platforms as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike official government websites that end with .gov or .mil, profiles created through third-party platforms can often look deceptively authentic, but are used to mislead the public and steal personal information.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kids, Safety and Social Media</title>
            <description>For better or worse, we are all on high alert about the whereabouts of children, even those who are not our own. Adults who saw a creepy looking 18-year-old at a coffee shop sweet-talking an underage girl would become suspicious and some might even contact the authorities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And certainly parents today — who sometimes go to the lengths of attaching GPS devices to their kids backpacks and tracking them using cellphone apps — would never allow an adult male to have regular unsupervised contact with their young daughters. But it happens regularly through social media.&lt;br /&gt;

Jessica Williams, chief probation officer and program director of the Ross County Probation Department, created a Facebook page for the agency a few weeks ago.

            <title>Ignorance is Bliss for Legal Bloggers and Publishers</title>
            <description>Even though legal publishers, both law firms and traditional media, put a lot of time and effort into publishing, their publishing platforms are often outdated, deficient or broken. Worst of all, the publishers have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like many people I use Feedly, a news aggregator, to stay abreast of news, information, developments and commentary. Others use Manzama, Zama, Flipboard or corporate-installed news aggregators. I liberally share what I read directly from Feedly to Twitter, and to a lesser extent Facebook and LinkedIn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social sharing like this is how news moves today, lots of people read and share. We call it social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the items shared are shared by a select group within particular industries. They are called the influencers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Has Social Media Ruined Our Perception of Newsworthy Stories?</title>
            <description>According to a study by Pew Research, the number of people who get their news from Facebook and Twitter has increased significantly over the past few years.

            <title>Munch is a fast efficient RSS Reader for Android</title>
            <description>Feeds are added one after the other to Munch which is the program&apos;s greatest shortcoming, especially if you have an opml file full of feeds already that you would like to import.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This means that you need to add feed after feed manually in the application which is a problem considering that you need to get hold of feed urls first somehow to do so.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media is driving our lives right now. You may say that is untrue, but I say you are in denial unless you are one of those emasculated men who share a Facebook account with your wife or you are part of the 1 percent who spends little to no time online. This is 2016 and Facebook has more than one billion daily active users. One billion. Daily. Active. Users. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>LinkedIn for Lawyers: Newly Issued Ethical Guidance Makes Social Media Use Less Risky</title>
            <description>The ethics guidance interpreting &lt;i&gt;Attorney Advertising&lt;/i&gt; rules in the social media context continues to evolve, but this time the evolution appears to be for the better, taking into account the realities of the growing use of social media. As you may recall, early last year, the New York County Lawyers Association weighed in on the ethical implications for lawyers using LinkedIn and suggested that attorneys using the self-proclaimed &lt;i&gt;Worlds Largest Professional Network&lt;/i&gt; needed to beware that their posts on that site, even the most casual, did not run afoul of the attorney advertising rules. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The social network is testing multiple News Feeds inside its mobile app, as the feature is live for select users. In addition to the main feed, tabs for specific topics like Style, Travel and Headlines line the top of the interface. When you select one, the feed is distilled down to relevant posts from your friends and Pages you follow. Facebook says the feature is in the testing phase, so it could be a bit before it is open to all users.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Revamping Your Social Media Sites for the New Year</title>
            <description>The end of the year is drawing near, which means its time for fresh starts and new beginnings. While that does apply to whichever New Year’s resolution you plan to make in 2016 (and, in all likelihood, abandon by February), it applies to social media sites as well. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Unfriend and Unfollow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new year is the perfect time to go through your friends list with a fine-toothed comb. Here is a quick guide for whether you should be friends with someone online: Do you know who this person is? Have you seen him or her in the last year? Do you honestly think you’ll need to talk to him or her in the future?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The 4 Steps of a Social Media Audit</title>
            <description>The 4 well established steps of a social media audit include the following;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Review your Social Media profiles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where are you present?&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing to start from is mapping your social media presence. Locate all the social media accounts for your brand and write down the current status and audience size. This is a a great base to evaluate your presence on each platform at a later stage. Here’s an example from a recent social media audit for Twitter Counter.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Add a custom RSS feed to your Android home screen</title>
            <description>Android does not have a built-in RSS widget for your home screen. For that, we have to turn to the Google Play Store. The widget I happen to prefer for this is called RSS Widget. This app is free, does not have any ads, and does a great job of presenting your RSS feeds cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media is a big part of many peoples lives, and it can be a great tool to help build and maintain relationships, and for general self-expression. LinkedIn has 396 million users, Twitter has 307 million active users and Facebook almost 1.5 billion active users, according to Statista.com.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, social media can easily lend itself to blurring the line between users’ personal and professional lives. And any information — good or bad — posted to social media can be difficult to delete once it’s out there. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to become a more responsible social media user. Read on to find out how social media can hurt your career, and how to avoid social media mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>RSS has taken some big hits recently. Of course, people have been announcing the death of RSS pretty much since it came into existence, but when Google Reader bit the dust on July 1st, 2013, many were ready to place a wreath at the headstone and walk away. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook Merges RSS and Push Notification</title>
            <description>Facebook has released a new application called Notify that will allow its users to receive push notifications about breaking news, new movie trailers, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The move into real-time news is significant because could help Facebook achieve two goals: It could make the company more important to the media, and it could increase the traffic it sends to publishers. Now, whether the app will be successful or just something that clogs up your phones notifications feed is another set of questions all together.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media allows you to connect with the world, but many seemingly harmless quizzes and games can really be traps laid by social media hackers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The simple and sometimes silly surveys that pop up on Facebook feeds often ask simple questions that may appear simple enough: What&apos;s your favorite color? Where did you grow up? What is your spirit animal? Where did you go to high school?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Using Social Media for Public Good</title>
            <description>A man suspected of a double murder was on the run, and a lot of people turned to the Knox County prosecutors Facebook page to find out about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Posts about the killings of Sandra Lee Stelk and Jaime Barber — who were found shot to death in a rural Knox County home on Sept. 30 — and about suspect Travis Bonham were each shared hundreds of times and reached more than 100,000 people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was good news to Prosecutor Chip McConville and his legal assistant and communications manager, Emily Morrison, who have worked since January to find ways to use social media that are helpful to the public.&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[Question for you to answer: What is YOUR goal for your business startup?<br />
<br />
I cannot stress enough the importance of knowing the answer to that question. A defined goal helps your team plan strategic & measurable steps; while, in the process, you also keep resources in check as you strive to reach it.<br />
<br />
It can be used as a tool to achieve either of these goals:<br />
<br />
increased email subscribers<br />
grow profitability<br />
get leads<br />
more website traffic to your website<br />

            <title>How to use Social Media to Create Happy Employees</title>
            <description>Did you know companies with happy employees outperform their competition by 20 percent?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
LinkedIn has carried out research to say that 58 percent of employees are proud of their company and are glad to tell others about it, especially on social media. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is great news, as happier employees means happier customers, because they pass on their energy &amp; passion in everything they do, including customer support. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But how can you create happy employees on social media? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>There Is Nothing Virtual About Building Relationships on Social Media</title>
            <description>I remember saying that if I could ever figure out how a person could be in two places at once I would retire a billionaire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because being in two places or more simultaneously is exactly what social media allows us to appear to do. With a nearly endless supply of apps designed to cross-post anything we can enter into a digital device, you would think the impossible had finally been achieved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certainly a lot of innovative people have ensured a comfortable retirement by making that illusion easy to create. But what is it costing entrepreneurs who fall prey to it?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Great Ideas for Blog Posts</title>
            <description>Blogs have increased in popularity because they provide a steady stream of new and unique content. The only issue presented by this quality of blogs is that it may become difficult for those who run blogs to think of interesting and novel posts. If you have jumped on the blogging bandwagon but suffer writer&apos;s block, do not panic: we have created a list of 26 ideas for blog posts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Make it visual. &lt;br /&gt;
Include a photo or other graphic in a blog post to break up the text, attract your reader&apos;s interest, or help illustrate a point. Better yet, talk about the image you have included to further incorporate it into the post.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Creative still counts&lt;br /&gt;
When we think of Amazon, we tend to think about deals and shipping. Everyone from your neighbor to your grandparents knows that Amazon probably has the best price on anything you could want to buy, and they know that the companys bread and butter is shipping it to you as quickly as possible. In other words, nearly every consumer out there knows what Amazon is about.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Warren Buffett Teaches Us All How to Use Social Media</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[While there are certainly dozens of insightful takeaways that could be gleaned from Buffetts 50-year career as an investor, I think everyone can benefit from learning more about one of his core principles that have guided him through good times and bad. <br />
<br />
Reputation matters<br />
One of my favorite all-time pieces of advice from Buffett is this: <i>It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'will do things differently.</i><br />
<br />
In many ways, the sheer simplicity and common-sense nature of that statement belies its profound implications for modern-day life. Throughout his career, Buffett has used his reputation sparingly to turn around a failing business or to gain a tactical advantage.<br />

            <title>XML Sitemaps Or RSS Feeds, Atom Feeds? Google Says Use Both For Optimal Crawling</title>
            <description>When it comes to telling search engines about the content on a website, webmasters might be wondering if they should submit sitemaps or just setup RSS or Atom feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Googles answer? Use both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For optimal crawling, we recommend using both XML sitemaps and RSS or Atom feeds. XML sitemaps will give Google information about all of the pages on your site. RSS feeds will provide all updates on your site, helping Google to keep your content fresher in its index. Note that submitting sitemaps or feeds does not guarantee the indexing of those URLs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>You Can Have your Ad Blockers, I Will stick with RSS</title>
            <description>RSS has never been fashionable — it is always been a news gathering tool for nerds, not norms. But now, more than two years after the untimely demise of Google Reader, RSS almost feels cool — like listening to vinyl or hating things on Twitter. RSS is a stealthy way to obtain news thats fast, friendly, and free from both ads and trackers. Its ubiquity makes me wonder why anyone bothers with browsers and adblockers at all, especially when mobile.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Text Messaging Ruining Our Youth?</title>
            <description>If you have noticed the apparent omnipresence of cell phones, as most of us surely have, it likely will not surprise you that about 86% of the worlds roughly seven billion people have access to a mobile phone, or that 80% of cell phone owners use their devices to send and receive text messages. You may also be unsurprised to learn that the vast majority of texts are sent by teenagers under eighteen, and that the average teen from this group sends over 3,300 texts each month.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>6 Social Media Marketing Trends for 2015</title>
            <description>As we look to 2015, what social media marketing trends are likely to develop? Here are six that online retailers should monitor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Niche Social Networks Will Emerge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mainstream social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn will face challenges from lesser-known upstarts in 2015. One example is Ello, an ad-free social platform still in beta that has received a great deal of attention among those that follow social media developments.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Keywords. They are still as powerful as they were in 1996 or the introduction of the Internet to the world. No matter what keywords you have, they can provide your content the kind of impact that it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>3 Tips for Promoting Your Products on Social Media</title>
            <description>&lt;b&gt;1. Plan around the online and social hit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Craft your pitches to include elements that readers will want to share on social media. Think about a creative way consumers can engage with your product along with a campaign hashtag. Just as when you include a storyline in a pitch, including decorations on your product’s theme can help editors imagine how to photograph them. This reduces one step of the design process for the publication and gives you additional influence on how your product is presented to the world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>50 Apps to Improve Smart Phones</title>
            <description>A recent study by market research firm Nielsen claimed that the average person uses 27 apps a month, which sounds like very few considering that Apple and Google’s app stores both have more than 1m apps available. The key, of course, is that the 27 apps can be almost entirely different, depending who you ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some apps do have mass audiences: Facebook and Twitter in the social networking category; WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat for messaging; Google Maps for getting around; Spotify for music; YouTube for video; Kindle for reading ebooks; Instagram for photo-sharing; and so on.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Working with RSS Feeds: Maximizing Your Content Stream</title>
            <description>An RSS feed is a means to distribute changing web content including blog posts, podcasts, news releases and site updates to related sites, blogs, online publishers and feed subscribers. It allows busy people to get the information they want without having to use email, which prevents the publisher from selling or otherwise providing their contract information to other parties.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 Reasons Why Social Media Buttons Hurt Nonprofit Websites</title>
            <description>That little row of social media buttons has become a ubiquitous feature of most websites. After all, it is good to show off that you are social, and that there are channels where you can interact directly with stakeholders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But is your website header or sidebar the best place to show that off?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are five reasons why having social media buttons on your nonprofits website might do more harm than good:&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>We often confuse relevance with creativity. Relevance is not about being cutting edge or participating in the latest fad. When it comes to social media, relevance is about delivering the right message to the right person at the right time through the right channel. Sometimes it is actually easier to understand relevance by looking at what it is not.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Identify Your Best Social Media Influencers</title>
            <description>Social media has become an integrated layer in our lives, available at almost every point in your day and even in space. It is this level of integration in our lives which has also made social media so powerful as a marketing tool and why just about every business has integrated it into their overall marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One important element of social media, if you really want to get the eyes, ears, and mouths of the people really making an impact, is to connect and engage with the influencers of each social platform.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The pressure to be available 24-7 on social media may lead to poorer sleep quality as well as an increased risk of depression and anxiety in teens, according to a new study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the study, researchers asked 467 teenagers ages 11 to 17 about their use of social media during the day and at night.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook Patents</title>
            <description>Facebook has been experiencing an uptick in terms of its intellectual property holdings in recent years. In 2014, the company was tied with Emerson Electric for 132nd overall with 279 patents issued that year by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, an increase of almost 120 percent over the companys patenting pace the previous year. Facebooks already earned 250 U.S. patents in 2015 according to Innography, making it very likely that the company will post higher patent totals this year. The text cluster provided here shows us that much of the companys recent innovation focuses on social networking, although user interfaces and computing devices were also large areas of focus.&lt;br /&gt;

In todays hyper-connected world, the candidate that inspires enough of the population to eventually win the election will likely also have excited enough of the public to &lt;i&gt;follow&lt;/i&gt; her or him on their various social media networks.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Teens who feel a round-the-clock compulsion to participate on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter may pay a price in lost sleep. They may also face a higher risk for depression and anxiety, new research suggests.&lt;br /&gt;

British researchers surveyed nearly 470 teens to explore how 24-7 social media participation might affect their emotional health.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>After Years Of Restraint, Facebook Tries Allowing GIFs In Ads And Page Posts</title>
            <description>Facebook refused to fill its site with flashy animated banner ads for a decade. Zuckerberg thought these interrupted the user experience, and could stunt growth. But after reaching near ubiquity and acclimating users to video ads, today the company tells me it’s relaxing its standards and starting to allow businesses to post GIFs as ads and Page posts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The 15 Social Media Trends that Defined a Generation</title>
            <description>Over the past few years, social media has given rise to a number of crazes that have quickly spread across the web; with the likes of Twitter and Facebook, a trend started in Devon can reach Delaware in a matter of minutes. In the past 5 years, social media trends have got bigger and bigger, and in some cases wackier and wackier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the more absurd trends like Batmanning and Cinnamon Challenge, to those with an underlying charitable cause like the Ice Bucket Challenge, social media trends spread like wildfire. Chances are you will have had at least a handful of trends pop up on your social media feeds over the years.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create a social network or risk everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the original pitch for Googles Facebook rival, Google+, a refrain hammered over and over by the social network&apos;s chief architect, Vic Gundotra, in meetings with the companys top brass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gundotra, described by colleagues we spoke with as charismatic and politically-savvy, eventually persuaded Larry Page, the Google cofounder who returned as CEO at the beginning of 2011 after a decade behind the scenes, to turn the company upside down for this cause.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Could Deal your Brand a Blow</title>
            <description>Decide how you intend to use social media and to whom you will allow access, especially on Facebook. You do not necessarily need to completely sanitise all your social media profiles — because companies want to hire real people, and some companies specifically look for creativity and personality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, if you want to ensure a potential employer does not reject you on those grounds, make sure your online social profile depicts the type of employee a company would want to hire.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The Federal Trade Commission rolled out its latest truth in advertising guidelines. The last time the FTC updated its guidelines for truth in advertising was back in 2010. The new guidelines may precede a crackdown for social media marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their effect on social media marketing includes how marketers handle the use of celebrity endorsements. The FTC recommends that marketers have a proper disclosure check up to make sure that their social media marketing campaigns fall within FTC guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
XML sitemaps serve as a way to communicate directly with the search engines, alerting them to new or changed content very quickly and helping to ensure that the content is indexed faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For content publishers, it has become critical to help Google specifically understand if your site is the original publisher of content. Why? Panda.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Your Small Business Can Use Social Media to Boost Sales</title>
            <description>In 2014, consumer shopping behavior evolved rapidly. Shopping online and through mobile devices is the new norm, and the experience has become increasingly more social with platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These platforms, in turn, have launched new commerce capabilities like the &lt;i&gt;buy &lt;/i&gt;button.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Separate the Personal and Professional on Social Media</title>
            <description>n a recent research study, we spoke with dozens of professionals about their use of social media, and were struck by the variety of approaches they are using.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some professionals, we found, still manage to avoid social media altogether. But most see that as unrealistic in many occupations, and are unwilling to be deprived of the advantages social media affords in terms of connecting to people and collecting information.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>When standardized tests are shared nationwide—as they now are, under the Common Core system that&apos;s been adopted in 46 states—cheating suddenly becomes a whole lot easier. Especially since teenagers now share just about everything on social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>News reader applications like Feedly or Flipboard are great for browsing and even searching through news items, but they lack the ability to send notifications proactively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emails from Google Alerts can be tardy, and at other times, articles can slip by completely.&lt;br /&gt;

Never fear!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Used together, two web applications, IFTTT and Feed Rinse,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;solve this problem easily.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Makes You Spend More</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<i>When I ran a Facebook ad recently for a nonprofit where I volunteer, I was surprised how specific you could get in targeting potential customers. If I wanted to advertise the event I was promoting to women between the ages of 24 and 26 in my city who were unmarried and educated, who watched Girls, owned a dog and liked designer purses — I could do that.</i><br />
<i></i><br />
<i>Being able to target ads to a specific market can help a seller reach the people who want or need their products and services. Unfortunately, that means buyers may also be encouraged to spend more than they should if they are not mindful.</i><br />

            <title>How To Use Social Media To Attract New Clients</title>
            <description>One of the interesting qualities of freelancing work is that you may never meet your clients in real life. Perhaps more than any other job market, freelancers rely heavily on their online image- an aggregate of their resume, portfolio and personality to set themselves apart and attract new clients who may very well be located on the other side of the world.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>29 Rules of Social Media</title>
            <description>How did you end up learning the unwritten rules for social media etiquette?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For me, it was a lot of watching and waiting, a bit of experimenting, and tons of trial and error. When I first started out on social media, I had just the most basic rules and intuitions. Even now, I feel like I learn a new quirk or quibble on a near-daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Link RSS feeds to email with Blogtrottr</title>
            <description>RSS feeds are fine if you can find a good feed reader and the time to grind through the results, but let’s face it - email is the center of most people’s universes. So why not converge RSS and email? If this sounds like something you would like to do, you need to take a look at the Web service Blogtrottr.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blogtrottr is simple to use: you enter a feed URL, the address you wish to have the email of the feed sent to, select the frequency of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Marketing Tools That Build Your Reach and Credibility</title>
            <description>As an early adopter of media since the early 80s, I love everything about media, its immediacy, urgency, fluidity, and ability to impact the masses and unify people and ideas in real time, in the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social marketing continues to be a powerful force for good, but as we know it can be a dangerous platform for bad too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through prior careers in entertainment and broadcast radio sales, and celebrating 8 years in my current social media consultancy, social marketing clearly is the most effective way to build branding, credibility and the bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>We have all seen the tragedies that have struck a little too close to home. Be they humans&apos; doing or the acts of mother nature, they are jarring at best, in part because they so often feel as though they are beyond our control. While we certainly can not prevent all tragedies, or even predict them, the way we react to such events can be powerfully influential. When crisis strikes, here are some things you can do to help yourself and those around you:&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>XML Sitemaps Or RSS Feeds? Google Says Use Both For Optimal Crawling</title>
            <description>For optimal crawling, we recommend using both XML sitemaps and RSS feeds. XML sitemaps will give Google information about all of the pages on your site. RSS feeds will provide all updates on your site, helping Google to keep your content fresher in its index. Note that submitting sitemaps or feeds does not guarantee the indexing of those URLs.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Reduces Stress for Women, But Not Men</title>
            <description>What is social media doing to us? Is it stressing us out with its never-ending pings announcing new baby pictures, engagements, and unimportant messages to respond to? Or is it keeping us connected to people, and therefore happier? These are tricky and loaded questions, but a new survey from Pew adds a bit of evidence to the &lt;i&gt;social media reduces stress&lt;/i&gt; side of the ledger. At least if you are a lady.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Summary Writing Hints and Tips That Get Great Results</title>
            <description>The summary is your hook to get readers to click on your article. Think of the summary as the hot fudge to your article titles ice cream. You can give a headline that states &lt;i&gt;Ice Cream&lt;/i&gt; and it may be enough to turn a few heads, but not likely. Add a quick summary that describes the ice cream in more depth – such as the promise of a creamy, chocolate, mouthwatering, hot-fudge sundae – and you are far more likely to get the attraction you want and need.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Facebooks automated &lt;i&gt;year in review &lt;/i&gt;slideshows are meant to surface highlights from the year that was, but for some the virtual scrapbook simply brings back bad memories. In the case of web designer Eric Meyer, a photo of his recently deceased daughter appeared, surrounded by confetti, illustrations of party goers dancing and the exclamation &lt;i&gt;Eric, here&apos;s what your year looked like&lt;/i&gt;! In response, Eric wrote a blog post about what he refers to as that apps &lt;i&gt;Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty&lt;/i&gt;, and pointing to the shortcomings of modern software design.&lt;br /&gt;

And while video will always garner a strong viewership, choosing to go the audio route is just as successful. Apple announced this year that they surpassed 1 billion subscriptions for podcasts through their iTunes app with additional apps like Soundcloud and iHeartRadio cropping up as a means to listen to even more podcasts hosted to the sites and major networks and celebrities getting on the podcasting bandwagon as well.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Tools to Help Discover and Monitor Negative SEO</title>
            <description>People define negative SEO in a variety of ways. Some consider it the malicious efforts of your competitors to either build unsavory links to your website or steal the best links from your website. Others would add website hacking, content theft, brand impersonation, and similar strategies to the list. I consider negative SEO anything that could harm your reputation, visibility, or traffic in search. With that in mind, here are some tools and services you can use to monitor negative SEO activity and the harm it does to your website and brand.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A World of Podcasts</title>
            <description>Podcasting is slowly becoming a huge market branching off from the likes of blogging and social media. Effectively, it is the same as blogging except instead of reading some words and looking at some pretty pictures, you actually hear the tone of voice behind the ideas and innovations. With a podcast you can infact truly determine the depth of the conversation and analyse the angles of communication through an individuals mind set. Reading is a huge global culture. It occurs every day from the sight of morning headline news to the vast pages in a legal document and the lunch menu at a team end-of-month munch-fest. You cannot escape it, even as you stare at the pixels on your laptop screen, text is everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 Social Media Security Tips To Protect Your Business</title>
            <description>Many small businesses recognize the benefits of having a social media presence for customer service and long-term marketing purposes. However, many are slow to recognize social medias security issues and how employees own social presence can add to the companys security issues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some companies restrict internal access. Others may prevent employees from having any corporate association outside of work on their own social platforms. This is due to the fact that whatever an employee says outside of work publicly can have a significant impact on the organization.&lt;br /&gt;

<br />
While experts work to define the return on investment, or ROI, of social-media attention and quantify the financial value of social media-fans and followers, entrepreneurs have an innate sense that there is power in gathering a following of likes for our brands.<br />

            <title>How to Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS may be antiquated to some because of the early days of online when RSS readers aggregated content from multiple sources and compiled them into one stream of news and headlines under an RSS reader. It made life easier for people because they did not have to go to dozens of slow Web sites to get their content. Instead, it all flowed to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Web and social media sites became more sophisticated and access speeds became faster, the RSS readers faded away. But the ability of sites to distribute their content to other sites and also collect content from other sites is still viable even today.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can not even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Experts say the case of a mother accused of poisoning her 5-year-old son to death with salt appears be an example of how social media feeds into Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers purposely harm children and then bask in the attention and sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Roost Takes on Twitter with RSS</title>
            <description>A new Y Combinator-backed startup called Roost wants to succeed where RSS readers perhaps failed with the introduction of a new service that lets consumers subscribe to websites using browser-based push notifications. However, unlike a browser plug-in system such as PageMonitor, for example, Roost is based on an upcoming standard for web push, which is built into Safari and is coming soon to Google Chrome and Firefox.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What To Say When You Do Not Like Social Media</title>
            <description>Interesting:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I do not use social media. Some of my friends keep asking me to join social media and interact with them that way. I tell them I consider social media to be a waste of time and that I have more important things to do. Yet they continue bugging me to join social media. What can I tell them to convince them it is better for me not to be on social media?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Can RSS Feeds Help SEO</title>
            <description>Any owner of a website that is marketing or promoting a product or a service is concerned about the amount of traffic it generates. Not only is the concern about traffic, but the quality of the traffic is really the key. If your website does not rank well in the search engines, it can limit the amount of sales that you make, so anything to improve the ranking is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One way to achieve a higher visibility is to improve the quality and the amount of relevant content whenever possible. One way to do this is to use RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Now that folks are posting and tweeting and retweeting - complaints and grievances around the clock, is every negative experience a possible class action? If someone has a bad experience with a bank or someone gets food poisoning at a restaurant or someone has a problem with a prescribed medicine, he can immediately find others with similar outrages. Are social media making it easier for plaintiffs to band together?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Teens, Social Media and the School System: Misunderstood or Toxic Relationship?</title>
            <description>The education system has its flaws. You do not have to be a researcher to know that. Am I biased? Of course I am, but so is everyone else who has ever been to school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The education we have in this country is incredible compared to some countries that do not. I am not disregarding them; I have the perspective of a student who has had the luxury of going to school my entire life and a pretty good one at that. Schools all over the world have flaws. Some are small but some are quite substantial. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Increase Sales on Ebay with RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>As eBay sellers continue to try to crack the code of Cassini, one suggestion coming from the eBay team is to refresh RSS feeds. If you are not familiar, an RSS feed is a technology where a web feed is used to distribute information, or to distribute content to a large number of people at one time. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. eBay sends an RSS feed to Google. Sellers do not have to do anything to make this happen - eBay automatically sends information about each listing to Google using RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Partial or Full RSS Feeds?</title>
            <description>It seems the opinions are mixed on partial versus full RSS feeds. Full feeds give the recipients complete access to what a blogger has published, with the convenience of never having to visit the actual blog. This can be a problem for the blogger, especially if they were hoping to gain more page views from their RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook Paper Launch</title>
            <description>Facebook on Thursday officially unveiled Paper, a new app created by Facebook Creative Labs, though it did so without any sort of big press event around the new application, which includes tons of content, including your news feed, news articles, photos and more. In other words, it s much more robust than a simple RSS feed replacement to compete with FlipBoard, as earlier rumors suggested it might be.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Track RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>For starters, it is important to understand that you do not need a service for RSS. Your RSS feed already exists without a third party service. The only thing a third party service would do for you is try to help keep track of subscribers. But even without that service, people can still subscribe to your feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>6 Months After Google Reader Shut Down</title>
            <description>6 months ago this day Google Reader shut down and the voices of millions of blog posts were suddenly silenced. Although there was a huge outcry before Google reader disappeared, on the actual day it went away it seemed to pass many users by without a word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the reason was that by this time a few groups had come out with alternative apps for the service so it was easy to miss but also many tweets and blog posts had been written venting their frustration. But 6 months on and the picture has changed a lot. The internet (at least for nerds) looks very different than it did before.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Over Sharing!</title>
            <description>In an effort to ensure UK courts can conduct fair trials, the UK Attorney Generals Office will soon start advising Facebook and Twitter users about the dangers of commenting on legal cases. In a world of super-injunctions and tweeted court cases, users have often shared sensitive legal information, believing they are entitled to free speech online. However, Facebook and Twitter posts are subject to the same laws that apply to newspapers and TV media, meaning a status update or a tweet about a case or defendant could go viral, potentially influencing a jury or revealing the names of victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The first step is to understand that you have very little control over the way in which people discover and come across your content. But once they do — and assuming they are interested in coming back — your responsibility is to give them a multiple-choice selection of avenues by which to do so.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>With more wearable devices entering the market, the way we read online content could change significantly. Instead of taking out a smartphone, readers of the near-future will more often read from devices like Google Glass or the Galaxy Gear.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>FeedForAll has made available a free PHP program called rss2html.php, which can be used by webmasters to automatically display RSS feeds on their website. The resulting webpage will always show the RSS feed&apos;s most current data. The advantage of using the rss2html.php script is that the resulting webpages contents will always be up to date, and can be easily spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Use RSS Readers To Save You Time</title>
            <description>Online media offers an amazing resource to anyone with an internet connection — countless articles, interviews, and reports, all waiting for you to click through and read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when you have so many options, sometimes you just can not remember all of the websites worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do You Manually Add RSS Feeds to Google Play</title>
            <description>By copying the entire RSS feed URL and pasting it into the search box in Newsstand, you can find a box you can add under&lt;i&gt; Feeds&lt;/i&gt;. This method seems to work, although for a couple of sample feeds I got an endless loading loop. Others might not show up at all if the app does not properly detect them.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines. While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Turn an RSS Feed into a Google Glass App</title>
            <description>As media companies race to adapt to their readers increased reliance on smartphones and tablets, creating content for the next frontier of devices--bodily extensions like Google Glass and smartwatches--probably falls into the “to do later” category for many publishers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Washington, D.C., startup Silica Labs is trying to change that with Wearab.ly, a platform that turns content from existing RSS feeds into apps formatted for wearable devices. Launched earlier this year as Simple Wing with a Google Glass app for National Geographic, the recently rebranded service has now cornered the D.C. media market with new relationships with NPR and Atlantic Media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For individuals who are using social media to market their organization, business, cause, etc., pervading every corner of the Internet with generic social media profiles is not the most effective strategy.

Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unsurprisingly, the most realistic sound effects tend to be recordings of actual sounds. To create these sound effects, the actual sounds that are recorded may also be edited or enhanced; sometimes, the pitch, intensity, or another aspect of the sound may be altered using software. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For some brands, it is not always clear what they want to accomplish from syndication. Is the goal to drive traffic to the main website in a fashion similar to SEO or paid search? Is the goal to build awareness of your products? Or is the goal something else entirely?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Make Your Own RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>For news, sports, entertainment, online publications and blogs, the benefits of implementing an RSS feed is obvious: Deliver information to your visitors even when they are not actively surfing your site, and they will be sure to come back when an item piques their interest. For other types of businesses, an RSS feed can keep you top-of-mind with your past customers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google+ RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS feeds are not officially supported by Google Plus yet, that&apos;s bad if you want to follow a specific user on the new social networking site. Sure, you could add the user to a circle to read all&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;messages on the Google Plus website, or visit the stream of that user directly to access the new messages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both options are not really that comfortable, especially if you do not hang out 24/7 on Google Plus. The alternative? You could try a service that turns a stream into an RSS feed&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Advertising</title>
            <description>More companies see the spread of RSS as a great way to get their information to users, and profit from advertising placed within those feeds too. Last October, JupiterResearch noted less than 10 percent of RSS feeds had advertising in them, and no major advertisers were using feeds as part of their marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Paid RSS Tools Market</title>
            <description>It has been a month since Google Reader shut down, breaking users hearts and bringing an end to a nearly eight-year run of RSS dominance. As soon as word came of Readers impending doom, third parties like Digg, Feedly, and others sprung into action, eager to replace the old guard. At the time, they looked like a rescue team, gallantly swooping in to save us from regular old web browsing. But after a month, the squad of reader replacements has turned into a set of regular products trying to keep up with user demands. So how well have these replacements done in Google Reader’s absence?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out it is hard to make an RSS reader. Feedly switched over to its own servers with just a few weeks to spare and Digg launched mere days before Readers lights-out. Newsblur had been running since 2009, but faced a flood of traffic after Google announced the reader shutdown, and founder Samuel Clay describes pulling 14-hour days for months just to keep the site loading in under 100 milliseconds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>14 Other Ways to Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Undeniably RSS is one of the best things that has happened to the web after email. Not only has it made browsing a lot more productive, convenient, fun … you name it, but it has also introduced a number of new ways to interact with content that we could never have imagined before. While you’re most probably already familiar with the idea of RSS feeds and Feedreader, there are several other ways you can make use of feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Future of FeedBurner</title>
            <description>&lt;i&gt;Google has treated Feedburner like a bad impulse buy ever since purchasing it in 2007, leaving it in a state of neglect. After the announcement that Google Reader was being discontinued, the Internet grapevine began buzzing about what Google service was next on the chopping block. The general consensus is that it will be Feedburner, since both the API and Adsense for Feeds have already been closed. It would make sense, if you are a webmaster, to redirect your RSS feed and newsletter subscribers to FeedPress before it&apos;s too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Still More Google Reader Alternatives</title>
            <description>Google Reader closed its virtual doors on July 2nd, becoming one of the largest Google services to get the axe. In the weeks leading up to its closure, several alternative RSS solutions emerged, hoping to win over the millions of people looking for a new Reader. But with literally dozens of entrants, it’s now much more difficult to find the right solution for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have tested all of the top solutions currently available and have selected the four best services for you. These are fully featured solutions, meaning you can manage them both from the Web and from Android or iOS apps. Here are our top four Google Reader alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Simple Way to Create RSS for Twitter</title>
            <description>Twitter has dropped support for RSS Feeds but there does exist a solution, slightly complicated though, that you may use to generate feeds for your various Twitter streams including Twitter search results, user timelines and even Twitter lists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without RSS feeds, it is difficult to use your Twitter data elsewhere. For instance, you can no longer create recipes in IFTTT that get triggered when you post a new tweet. You cannot import your Twitter timeline automatically into your blog. You cannot track Twitter search results for certain keywords in your RSS reader.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mention is Replacing Google Alerts</title>
            <description>We last caught up with Mention back in March, just as it had raised $800,000 to help develop its Google Alerts-esque service for the social Web&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, Mention has set out its stall to &lt;i&gt;reinvent Google Alerts&lt;/i&gt; with a system that allows users to receive real-time mentions – as you would expect – about anything online, across Windows, iOS, Android, the Web and Chrome. Though the service is largely used by companies to monitor mentions of their name, it can of course be used by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to use IFTTT to Automate</title>
            <description>You may think of the Web as a big tubular mesh of interconnectedness, but really, apps and sites tend to be more like islands than Kumbaya-singing cooperative circles. Evernote does not seamlessly save your notes to Dropbox. The Facebook photos you are tagged in do not automatically post to your Flickr account. Articles you save in Feedly do not push themselves to Pocket for later reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As explained below, IFTTT changes all that, bringing your various Web-service ingredients together into a smart, automatic, and, above all else, connected Internet stew. Yes, IFTTT makes the Web both scrumptious and ridiculously powerful, and we&apos;re going to show you how to brew up some deliciously useful recipes, as well as highlight some awesome IFTTT tasks that others have already created.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Easy Way to Subscribe to Twitter via RSS</title>
            <description>Last month, Twitter unfortunately killed-off RSS feeds for users of the service. Subscribing to your own Twitter feed is a great way to archive your tweets and make them searchable through whatever RSS Reader you’re using. Of course, now that Google Reader, too, has been killed-off, most of the other readers available right now do not have a search feature. However, most are promising to deliver that ability soon.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hootsuite RSS Syndicator</title>
            <description>As per an update on the 27 June 2013 on the Social Times, Hootsuite one of most popular platforms used by social media managers to efficiently update their accounts has finally launched the Hootsuite Syndicator, an RSS reader that would operate directly from the platform’s dashboard for users of Google Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the report, the users of Googles dashboard can now display their RSS feed directly from the account and seamlessly share the latest content across multiple social media networks. Those who use Google Chrome would get a special advantage of being able to subscribe to RSS feeds using by the installing the syndicator extension.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feedly Replaces Google Reader</title>
            <description>Feedly&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;launched in 2008 as a sort of alternative skin for Google Reader. Its interface was cleaner and more colorful, although Google Reader provided the engine behind Feedlys content-delivery system. Shortly after Google announced in March that it would shut Google Reader, Feedly declared that it would build its own backend engine; it was implemented in June.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The switch to Feedly may be born of necessity for Google Reader devotees, but it is hardly a sacrifice. Feedlys design and interface are more pleasant and intuitive than Googles, and keeping up with new content on the web is flat-out more fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To add content, hit the search icon at the top right corner of Feedly&apos;s main screen and a menu slides gracefully into view. From here, browse through several topics from among Feedlys featured choices, search for the title of a blog or publication with an RSS feed, or type the URL for the sites RSS feed into Feedlys search box.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Digg Reader Adds Top Requested Features</title>
            <description>Digg Reader, the Betaworks-backed alternative to the now-dead Google Reader, is making progress in becoming a more solidified platform for serious feed reading. Shortly after its launch a couple of weeks ago, it switched on the ability to display unread counts for feeds and folders, and last night, it added two more of users’ top requested features, the ability to view &lt;i&gt;only unread &lt;/i&gt; items and the &lt;i&gt;mark as unread&lt;/i&gt; option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the grand scheme of things, these are minor upgrades to a long-term roadmap where Digg envisions building a more fully fledged RSS reading experience – not just one that is on par with where Google Reader left off, but one that eventually extends beyond the original feature set to include things like a view into the popularity of posts across your network, advanced social-media sharing capabilities, and of course, the ability to feed posts to Digg.coms front page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Users have until 12 p.m. PST July 15 to download a copy of their Google Reader data via the Google Takeout data download service, the company said Tuesday in a final farewell blog post. After that time, all Reader subscription data, which includes lists of people followed, starred items and notes, will be systematically deleted from company servers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google Alerts Gets the Axe</title>
            <description>Google is really bidding a thorough goodbye to everything RSS this week. Not only did the company shut down the popular Google Reader for good on Monday, it has also stopped sending Google Alerts by RSS, according to Search Engine Land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Users who want to be notified by Google Alerts on specific search phrases or topics, but who don’t want the results clogging their inbox, will no longer be able to send them to Google Reader. Since Google Reader is now dead, the search giant is re-directing all Google Alerts that used to show up in your Reader to an email account of your choice. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For the last few weeks, we&apos;ve been hard at work building what we believe will be the best RSS reader on the market. And today, we&apos;re excited to announce the launch of AOL Reader.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Unique Perspective&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At AOL, we have a unique perspective on RSS readers and content aggregation apps because we are a publisher of content as well. Our goal is to create the best possible experience for users who want to read the best content on their phone, tablet, or desktop computer, whenever and wherever they want.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Ever since the advent of the internet there have been an untold amount of companies based around web technologies that have come and gone. The dot-com bubble of the 1990s filtered out many of the winners while shedding the losers. Over the years start-ups came and went, were bought, or just failed. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Real Reason Google Wants to Kill RSS</title>
            <description>Interesting article about why Google no longer wishes to support RSS Feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;RSS represents the antithesis of this new world: it is completely open, decentralized, and owned by nobody, just like the web itself. It allows anyone, large or small, to build something new and disrupt anyone else they would like because nobody has to fly six salespeople out first to work out a partnership with anyone elses salespeople.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Betaworks, the company that bought news site Digg last summer for $500,000, launched its eagerly anticipated Reader app today.&lt;br /&gt;

Digg Readers launch comes less than a week before Google is slated to kill its beloved Google Reader product, which pulls in news feeds from just about every news site on the Web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Digg works much the same way. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Google Reader Alternatives</title>
            <description>Google Reader is on its deathbed, slated to meet its end on July 1st. Its demise has been looming in the distance for a while, so this should come as no surprise. And while this is certainly a time of mourning, there&apos;s the unseemly business of finding a replacement. Here is a list of platform agnostic alternatives that should help make the transition as painless as possible.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Reader Comparison</title>
            <description>Feedly, one of the most popular RSS readers, has added functionalities to replace some of the actions users used to be able to do with Google Reader, like hosting feed subscriptions and offering a fully functional IFTTT channel. Digg will soon launch its own freemium-model reader this week, and AOL recently joined the club by releasing their own RSS reader.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dozens of smaller tech names are also promoting their services; it is a mad house out there in the RSS world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With so many companies pushing their tickets into your hands, how can you decide which RSS train to ride? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>If Google Can Not Get RSS to Work Why Are Others Trying?</title>
            <description>For anyone who has not been following this with pathological focus, here is the quick version: An RSS reader is a way to pull in feeds of articles from various websites, and people who revel in information overload love them. Google created one, called Google Reader, six years ago, and as it was state of the art at the time, it essentially took over the market. But then Google decided that several million news junkies were not worth its time, and on March 13 said it was getting out of the RSS business, opening the door to a handful of new companies to get in. The climax comes next week, when Google flips the switch and casts out its RSS enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some might interpret the fact that one of the Internets largest, richest companies abandoned this idea as a red flag. Not Feedly, Digg, AOL, Newsblur, and others, which are quickly developing their own readers to fill the Google Reader vacuum. It is not that they believe everyone wants to immerse themselves in an endless sea of headlines. Instead, they are betting that the technology will open up larger news-reading markets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
